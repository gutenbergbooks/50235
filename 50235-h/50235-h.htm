<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Many readers will no doubt be tempted to exclaim on seeing
my title: “Rousseau and no end!” The outpour of books on
Rousseau had indeed in the period immediately preceding the
war become somewhat portentous.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This preoccupation with
Rousseau is after all easy to explain. It is his somewhat formidable
privilege to represent more fully than any other one
person a great international movement. To attack Rousseau
or to defend him is most often only a way of attacking or
defending this movement.</p>

<p>It is from this point of view at all events that the present
work is conceived. I have not undertaken a systematic study
of Rousseau’s life and doctrines. The appearance of his name
in my title is justified, if at all, simply because he comes at a
fairly early stage in the international movement the rise and
growth of which I am tracing, and has on the whole supplied
me with the most significant illustrations of it. I have already
put forth certain views regarding this movement in three previous
volumes.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Though each one of these volumes attempts
to do justice to a particular topic, it is at the same time intended
to be a link in a continuous argument. I hope that I
may be allowed to speak here with some frankness of the main
trend of this argument both on its negative and on its positive,
or constructive, side.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best key to both sides of my argument is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
in the lines of Emerson I have taken as epigraph for “Literature
and the American College”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There are two laws discrete</div>
<div class="verse">Not reconciled,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Law for man, and law for thing;</div>
<div class="verse">The last builds town and fleet,</div>
<div class="verse">But it runs wild,</div>
<div class="verse">And doth the man unking.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On its negative side my argument is directed against this undue
emphasis on the “law for thing,” against the attempt to erect on
naturalistic foundations a complete philosophy of life. I define
two main forms of naturalism&mdash;on the one hand, utilitarian
and scientific and, on the other, emotional naturalism. The
type of romanticism I am studying is inseparably bound up
with emotional naturalism.</p>

<p>This type of romanticism encouraged by the naturalistic
movement is only one of three main types I distinguish and I
am dealing for the most part with only one aspect of it. But
even when thus circumscribed the subject can scarcely be said
to lack importance; for if I am right in my conviction as to the
unsoundness of a Rousseauistic philosophy of life, it follows
that the total tendency of the Occident at present is away from
rather than towards civilization.</p>

<p>On the positive side, my argument aims to reassert the “law
for man,” and its special discipline against the various forms
of naturalistic excess. At the very mention of the word discipline
I shall be set down in certain quarters as reactionary. But
does it necessarily follow from a plea for the human law that
one is a reactionary or in general a traditionalist? An American
writer of distinction was once heard to remark that he saw in
the world to-day but two classes of persons,&mdash;the mossbacks
and the mountebanks, and that for his part he preferred to be
a mossback. One should think twice before thus consenting to
seem a mere relic of the past. The ineffable smartness of our
young radicals is due to the conviction that, whatever else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
they may be, they are the very pink of modernity. Before
sharing their conviction it might be well to do a little preliminary
defining of such terms as modern and the modern spirit.
It may then turn out that the true difficulty with our young
radicals is not that they are too modern but that they are not
modern enough. For, though the word modern is often and no
doubt inevitably used to describe the more recent or the most
recent thing, this is not its sole use. It is not in this sense alone
that the word is used by writers like Goethe and Sainte-Beuve
and Renan and Arnold. What all these writers mean by the
modern spirit is the positive and critical spirit, the spirit that
refuses to take things on authority. This is what Renan means,
for example, when he calls Petrarch the “founder of the modern
spirit in literature,” or Arnold when he explains why the
Greeks of the great period seem more modern to us than the
men of the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Now what I have myself tried to do is to be thoroughly
modern in this sense. I hold that one should not only welcome
the efforts of the man of science at his best to put the natural
law on a positive and critical basis, but that one should strive
to emulate him in one’s dealings with the human law; and so
become a complete positivist. My main objection to the movement
I am studying is that it has failed to produce complete
positivists. Instead of facing honestly the emergency created
by its break with the past the leaders of this movement have
inclined to deny the duality of human nature, and then sought
to dissimulate this mutilation of man under a mass of intellectual
and emotional sophistry. The proper procedure in refuting
these incomplete positivists is not to appeal to some dogma or
outer authority but rather to turn against them their own principles.
Thus Diderot, a notable example of the incomplete
positivist and a chief source of naturalistic tendency, says
that “everything is experimental in man.” Now the word
experimental has somewhat narrowed in meaning since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
time of Diderot. If one takes the saying to mean that everything
in man is a matter of experience one should accept it
unreservedly and then plant oneself firmly on the facts of
experience that Diderot and other incomplete positivists have
refused to recognize.</p>

<p>The man who plants himself, not on outer authority but on
experience, is an individualist. To be modern in the sense I
have defined is not only to be positive and critical, but also&mdash;and
this from the time of Petrarch&mdash;to be individualistic.
The establishment of a sound type of individualism is indeed
the specifically modern problem. It is right here that the failure
of the incomplete positivist, the man who is positive only
according to the natural law, is most conspicuous. What prevails
in the region of the natural law is endless change and
relativity; therefore the naturalistic positivist attacks all the
traditional creeds and dogmas for the very reason that they
aspire to fixity. Now all the ethical values of civilization have
been associated with these fixed beliefs; and so it has come to
pass that with their undermining by naturalism the ethical
values themselves are in danger of being swept away in the
everlasting flux. Because the individual who views life positively
must give up unvarying creeds and dogmas “anterior,
exterior, and superior” to himself, it has been assumed that he
must also give up standards. For standards imply an element
of oneness somewhere, with reference to which it is possible to
measure the mere manifoldness and change. The naturalistic
individualist, however, refuses to recognize any such element of
oneness. His own private and personal self is to be the measure
of all things and this measure itself, he adds, is constantly
changing. But to stop at this stage is to be satisfied with the
most dangerous of half-truths. Thus Bergson’s assertion that
“life is a perpetual gushing forth of novelties” is in itself only
a dangerous half-truth of this kind. The constant element in life
is, no less than the element of novelty and change, a matter of
observation and experience. As the French have it, the more life
changes the more it is the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>If, then, one is to be a sound individualist, an individualist
with human standards&mdash;and in an age like this that has cut
loose from its traditional moorings, the very survival of civilization
would seem to hinge on its power to produce such a
type of individualist&mdash;one must grapple with what Plato
terms the problem of the One and the Many. My own solution
of this problem, it may be well to point out, is not purely
Platonic. Because one can perceive immediately an element of
unity in things, it does not follow that one is justified in establishing
a world of essences or entities or “ideas” above the
flux. To do this is to fall away from a positive and critical into a
more or less speculative attitude; it is to risk setting up a metaphysic
of the One. Those who put exclusive emphasis on the
element of change in things are in no less obvious danger of
falling away from the positive and critical attitude into a metaphysic
of the Many.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This for example is the error one finds
in the contemporary thinkers who seem to have the cry, thinkers
like James and Bergson and Dewey and Croce. They are
very far from satisfying the requirements of a complete positivism;
they are seeking rather to build up their own intoxication
with the element of change into a complete view of life, and so
are turning their backs on one whole side of experience in a way
that often reminds one of the ancient Greek sophists. The
history of philosophy since the Greeks is to a great extent the
history of the clashes of the metaphysicians of the One and the
metaphysicians of the Many. In the eyes of the complete positivist
this history therefore reduces itself largely to a monstrous
logomachy.</p>

<p>Life does not give here an element of oneness and there an
element of change. It gives a <i>oneness that is always changing</i>.
The oneness and the change are inseparable. Now if what is
stable and permanent is felt as real, the side of life that is
always slipping over into something else or vanishing away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
entirely is, as every student of psychology knows, associated
rather with the feeling of illusion. If a man attends solely to
this side of life he will finally come, like Leconte de Lisle,
to look upon it as a “torrent of mobile chimeras,” as an “endless
whirl of vain appearances.” To admit that the oneness
of life and the change are inseparable is therefore to admit
that such reality as man can know positively is inextricably
mixed up with illusion. Moreover man does not observe the
oneness that is always changing from the outside; he is a part
of the process, he is himself a oneness that is always changing.
Though imperceptible at any particular moment, the continuous
change that is going on leads to differences&mdash;those, let us
say, between a human individual at the age of six weeks and the
same individual at the age of seventy&mdash;which are sufficiently
striking: and finally this human oneness that is always changing
seems to vanish away entirely. From all this it follows that
an enormous element of illusion&mdash;and this is a truth the East
has always accepted more readily than the West&mdash;enters into
the idea of personality itself. If the critical spirit is once allowed
to have its way, it will not rest content until it has
dissolved life into a mist of illusion. Perhaps the most positive
and critical account of man in modern literature is that of
Shakespeare:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent5">We are such stuff</div>
<div class="verse">As dreams are made on, and our little life</div>
<div class="verse">Is rounded with a sleep.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, though strictly considered, life is but a web of illusion
and a dream within a dream, it is a dream that needs to be
managed with the utmost discretion, if it is not to turn into
a nightmare. In other words, however much life may mock the
metaphysician, the problem of conduct remains. There is always
the unity at the heart of the change; it is possible, however,
to get at this real and abiding element and so at the
standards with reference to which the dream of life may be
rightly managed only through a veil of illusion. The problem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the One and the Many, the ultimate problem of thought, can
therefore be solved only by a right use of illusion. In close
relation to illusion and the questions that arise in connection
with it is all that we have come to sum up in the word imagination.
The use of this word, at least in anything like its present
extension, is, one should note, comparatively recent. Whole
nations and periods of the past can scarcely be said to have
had any word corresponding to imagination in this extended
sense. Yet the thinkers of the past have treated, at times profoundly,
under the head of fiction or illusion the questions that
we should treat under the head of imagination.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the “Masters
of Modern French Criticism” I was above all preoccupied
with the problem of the One and the Many and the failure of
the nineteenth century to deal with it adequately. My effort
in this present work is to show that this failure can be retrieved
only by a deeper insight into the imagination and its all-important
rôle in both literature and life. Man is cut off from
immediate contact with anything abiding and therefore worthy
to be called real, and condemned to live in an element of fiction
or illusion, but he may, I have tried to show, lay hold with the
aid of the imagination on the element of oneness that is inextricably
blended with the manifoldness and change and to just
that extent may build up a sound model for imitation. One tends
to be an individualist with true standards, to put the matter
somewhat differently, only in so far as one understands the
relation between appearance and reality&mdash;what the philosophers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
call the epistemological problem. This problem, though
it cannot be solved abstractly and metaphysically, can be solved
practically and in terms of actual conduct. Inasmuch as modern
philosophy has failed to work out any such solution, it is
hard to avoid the conclusion that modern philosophy is bankrupt,
not merely from Kant, but from Descartes.</p>

<p>The supreme maxim of the ethical positivist is: By their
fruits shall ye know them. If I object to a romantic philosophy
it is because I do not like its fruits. I infer from its fruits that
this philosophy has made a wrong use of illusion. “All those
who took the romantic promises at their face value,” says
Bourget, “rolled in abysses of despair and ennui.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> If any one
still holds, as many of the older romanticists held, that it is a
distinguished thing to roll in abysses of despair and ennui, he
should read me no further. He will have no sympathy with my
point of view. If any one, on the other hand, accepts my criterion
but denies that Rousseauistic living has such fruits, it has
been my aim so to accumulate evidence that he will be confronted
with the task of refuting not a set of theories but a body
of facts. My whole method, let me repeat, is experimental, or
it might be less ambiguous to say if the word were a fortunate
one, experiential. The illustrations I have given of any particular
aspect of the movement are usually only a small fraction
of those I have collected&mdash;themselves no doubt only a fraction
of the illustrations that might be collected from printed
sources. M. Maigron’s investigation<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> into the fruits of romantic
living suggests the large additions that might be made to these
printed sources from manuscript material.</p>

<p>My method indeed is open in one respect to grave misunderstanding.
From the fact that I am constantly citing passages
from this or that author and condemning the tendency for
which these passages stand, the reader will perhaps be led to
infer a total condemnation of the authors so quoted. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
inference may be very incorrect. I am not trying to give rounded
estimates of individuals&mdash;delightful and legitimate as that
type of criticism is&mdash;but to trace main currents as a part of my
search for a set of principles to oppose to naturalism. I call
attention for example to the Rousseauistic and primitivistic
elements in Wordsworth but do not assert that this is the whole
truth about Wordsworth. One’s views as to the philosophical
value of Rousseauism must, however, weigh heavily in a total
judgment of Wordsworth. Criticism is such a difficult art
because one must not only have principles but must apply
them flexibly and intuitively. No one would accuse criticism at
present of lacking flexibility. It has grown so flexible in fact as
to become invertebrate. One of my reasons for practicing the
present type of criticism, is the conviction that because of a
lack of principles the type of criticism that aims at rounded
estimates of individuals is rapidly ceasing to have any meaning.</p>

<p>I should add that if I had attempted rounded estimates
they would often have been more favorable than might be
gathered from my comments here and elsewhere on the romantic
leaders. One is justified in leaning towards severity in the
laying down of principles, but should nearly always incline to
indulgence in the application of them. In a sense one may say
with Goethe that the excellencies are of the individual, the
defects of the age. It is especially needful to recall distinctions
of this kind in the case of Rousseau himself and my treatment
of him. M. Lanson has dwelt on the strange duality of Rousseau’s
nature. “The writer,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span> “is a poor dreamy creature
who approaches action only with alarm and with every
manner of precaution, and who understands the applications
of his boldest doctrines in a way to reassure conservatives and
satisfy opportunists. But the work for its part detaches itself
from the author, lives its independent life, and, heavily charged
with revolutionary explosives which neutralize the moderate
and conciliatory elements Rousseau has put into it for his own
satisfaction, it exasperates and inspires revolt and fires enthusiasms
and irritates hatreds; it is the mother of violence, the
source of all that is uncompromising, it launches the simple
souls who give themselves up to its strange virtue upon the
desperate quest of the absolute, an absolute to be realized
now by anarchy and now by social despotism.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I am inclined
to discover in the Rousseau who, according to M. Lanson, is
merely timorous, a great deal of shrewdness and at times something
even better than shrewdness. The question is not perhaps
very important, for M. Lanson is surely right in affirming that
the Rousseau who has moved the world&mdash;and that for reasons
I shall try to make plain&mdash;is Rousseau the extremist and foe
of compromise; and so it is to this Rousseau that as a student
of main tendencies I devote almost exclusive attention. I am
not, however, seeking to make a scapegoat even of the radical
and revolutionary Rousseau. One of my chief objections, indeed,
to Rousseauism, as will appear in the following pages, is that
it encourages the making of scapegoats.</p>

<p>If I am opposed to Rousseauism because of its fruits in
experience, I try to put what I have to offer as a substitute on
the same positive basis. Now experience is of many degrees:
first of all one’s purely personal experience, an infinitesimal
fragment; and then the experience of one’s immediate circle,
of one’s time and country, of the near past and so on in widening
circles. The past which as dogma the ethical positivist rejects,
as experience he not only admits but welcomes. He can
no more dispense with it indeed than the naturalistic positivist
can dispense with his laboratory. He insists moreover on
including the remoter past in his survey. Perhaps the most
pernicious of all the conceits fostered by the type of progress we
owe to science is the conceit that we have outgrown this older
experience. One should endeavor, as Goethe says, to oppose to
the aberrations of the hour, the masses of universal history.
There are special reasons just now why this background to
which one appeals should not be merely Occidental. An increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
material contact between the Occident and the Far East is
certain. We should be enlightened by this time as to the perils
of material contact between men and bodies of men who have
no deeper understanding. Quite apart from this consideration
the experience of the Far East completes and confirms in a
most interesting way that of the Occident. We can scarcely
afford to neglect it if we hope to work out a truly ecumenical
wisdom to oppose to the sinister one-sidedness of our current
naturalism. Now the ethical experience of the Far East may
be summed up for practical purposes in the teachings and
influence of two men, Confucius and Buddha.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> To know the
Buddhistic and Confucian teachings in their true spirit is to
know what is best and most representative in the ethical experience
of about half the human race for over seventy generations.</p>

<p>A study of Buddha and Confucius suggests, as does a study
of the great teachers of the Occident, that under its bewildering
surface variety human experience falls after all into a few
main categories. I myself am fond of distinguishing three levels
on which a man may experience life&mdash;the naturalistic, the
humanistic, and the religious. Tested by its fruits Buddhism
at its best confirms Christianity. Submitted to the same test
Confucianism falls in with the teaching of Aristotle and in
general with that of all those who from the Greeks down have
proclaimed decorum and the law of measure. This is so obviously
true that Confucius has been called the Aristotle of the
East. Not only has the Far East had in Buddhism a great
religious movement and in Confucianism a great humanistic
movement, it has also had in early Taoism<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> a movement that
in its attempts to work out naturalistic equivalents of humanistic
or religious insight, offers almost startling analogies to
the movement I am here studying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus both East and West have not only had great religious
and humanistic disciplines which when tested by their fruits
confirm one another, bearing witness to the element of oneness,
the constant element in human experience, but these
disciplines have at times been conceived in a very positive
spirit. Confucius indeed, though a moral realist, can scarcely
be called a positivist; he aimed rather to attach men to the past
by links of steel. He reminds us in this as in some other ways
of the last of the great Tories in the Occident, Dr. Johnson.
Buddha on the other hand was an individualist. He wished
men to rest their belief neither on his authority<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> nor on that
of tradition.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> No one has ever made a more serious effort to
put religion on a positive and critical basis. It is only proper
that I acknowledge my indebtedness to the great Hindu positivist:
my treatment of the problem of the One and the Many,
for example, is nearer to Buddha than to Plato. Yet even if the
general thesis be granted that it is desirable to put the “law
for man” on a positive and critical basis, the question remains
whether the more crying need just now is for positive and
critical humanism or for positive and critical religion. I have
discussed this delicate and difficult question more fully in my
last chapter, but may give at least one reason here for inclining
to the humanistic solution. I have been struck in my study of
the past by the endless self-deception to which man is subject
when he tries to pass too abruptly from the naturalistic to the
religious level. The world, it is hard to avoid concluding, would
have been a better place if more persons had made sure they
were human before setting out to be superhuman; and this
consideration would seem to apply with special force to a generation
like the present that is wallowing in the trough of
naturalism. After all to be a good humanist is merely to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
moderate and sensible and decent. It is much easier for a man
to deceive himself and others regarding his supernatural lights
than it is regarding the degree to which he is moderate and
sensible and decent.</p>

<p>The past is not without examples of a positive and critical
humanism. I have already mentioned Aristotle. If by his
emphasis on the mediatory virtues he reminds one of Confucius,
by his positive method and intensely analytical temper
he reminds one rather of Buddha. When Aristotle rises to the
religious level and discourses of the “life of vision” he is very
Buddhistic. When Buddha for his part turns from the religious
life to the duties of the layman he is purely Aristotelian.
Aristotle also deals positively with the natural law. He is
indeed a complete positivist, and not, like the man of the
nineteenth century, positive according to the natural law alone.
The Aristotle that should specially concern us, however, is the
positive and critical humanist&mdash;the Aristotle, let us say, of
the “Ethics” and “Politics” and “Poetics.” Just as I have
called the point of view of the scientific and utilitarian naturalist
Baconian,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and that of the emotional naturalist Rousseauistic,
so I would term the point of view that I am myself seeking
to develop Aristotelian. Aristotle has laid down once for all the
principle that should guide the ethical positivist. “Truth,” he
says, “in matters of moral action is judged from facts and from
actual life. … So what we should do is to examine the preceding
statements [of Solon and other wise men] by referring
them to facts and to actual life, and when they harmonize
with facts we may accept them, when they are at variance
with them conceive of them as mere theories.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It is in this sense alone that I aspire to be called an Aristotelian;
for one risks certain misunderstandings in using the name
of Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The authority of this great positivist has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
invoked innumerable times throughout the ages as a substitute
for direct observation. Aristotle was not only the prop and
mainstay of dogma for centuries during the Middle Ages, but
dogmatic Aristotelianism survived to no small extent, especially
in literature, throughout the neo-classical period. It was
no doubt natural enough that the champions of the modern
spirit should have rejected Aristotle along with the traditional
order of which he had been made a support. Yet if they had
been more modern they might have seen in him rather a chief
precursor. They might have learned from him how to have
standards and at the same time not be immured in dogma.
As it is, those who call themselves modern have come to adopt
a purely exploratory attitude towards life. “On desperate seas
long wont to roam,” they have lost more and more the sense of
what is normal and central in human experience. But to get
away from what is normal and central is to get away from wisdom.
My whole argument on the negative side, if I may venture
on a final summing up, is that the naturalistic movement
in the midst of which we are still living had from the start this
taint of eccentricity. I have tried to show in detail the nature
of the aberration. As for the results, they are being written
large in disastrous events. On its constructive side, my argument,
if it makes any appeal at all, will be to those for whom
the symbols through which the past has received its wisdom
have become incredible, and who, seeing at the same time that
the break with the past that took place in the eighteenth century
was on unsound lines, hold that the remedy for the partial
positivism that is the source of this unsoundness, is a more
complete positivism. Nothing is more perilous than to be only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
half critical. This is to risk being the wrong type of individualist&mdash;the
individualist who has repudiated outer control without
achieving inner control. “People mean nowadays by a
philosopher,” says Rivarol, “not the man who learns the great
art of mastering his passions or adding to his insight, but the
man who has cast off prejudices without acquiring virtues.”
That view of philosophy has not ceased to be popular. The
whole modern experiment is threatened with breakdown
simply because it has not been sufficiently modern. One should
therefore not rest content until one has, with the aid of the
secular experience of both the East and the West, worked out
a point of view so modern that, compared with it, that of our
young radicals will seem antediluvian.</p>

<h1>ROUSSEAU
AND ROMANTICISM</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TERMS CLASSIC AND ROMANTIC</span></h2>

<p>The words classic and romantic, we are often told, cannot
be defined at all, and even if they could be defined,
some would add, we should not be much profited. But
this inability or unwillingness to define may itself turn
out to be only one aspect of a movement that from Rousseau
to Bergson has sought to discredit the analytical
intellect&mdash;what Wordsworth calls “the false secondary
power by which we multiply distinctions.” However,
those who are with Socrates rather than with Rousseau
or Wordsworth in this matter, will insist on the importance
of definition, especially in a chaotic era like the
present; for nothing is more characteristic of such an
era than its irresponsible use of general terms. Now to
measure up to the Socratic standard, a definition must
not be abstract and metaphysical, but experimental;
it must not, that is, reflect our opinion of what a word
should mean, but what it actually has meant. Mathematicians
may be free at times to frame their own definitions,
but in the case of words like classic and romantic,
that have been used innumerable times, and used not in
one but in many countries, such a method is inadmissible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
One must keep one’s eye on actual usage. One should
indeed allow for a certain amount of freakishness in this
usage. Beaumarchais, for example, makes classic synonymous
with barbaric.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> One may disregard an occasional
aberration of this kind, but if one can find only confusion
and inconsistency in all the main uses of words like
classic and romantic, the only procedure for those who
speak or write in order to be understood is to banish the
words from their vocabulary.</p>

<p>Now to define in a Socratic way two things are necessary:
one must learn to see a common element in things
that are apparently different and also to discriminate
between things that are apparently similar. A Newton,
to take the familiar instance of the former process, saw
a common element in the fall of an apple and the motion
of a planet; and one may perhaps without being a literary
Newton discover a common element in all the main
uses of the word romantic as well as in all the main
uses of the word classic; though some of the things to
which the word romantic in particular has been applied
seem, it must be admitted, at least as far apart as the fall
of an apple and the motion of a planet. The first step is
to perceive the something that connects two or more of
these things apparently so diverse, and then it may be
found necessary to refer this unifying trait itself back
to something still more general, and so on until we arrive,
not indeed at anything absolute&mdash;the absolute
will always elude us&mdash;but at what Goethe calls the
original or underlying phenomenon (<i>Urphänomen</i>).
A fruitful source of false definition is to take as primary
in a more or less closely allied group of facts what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
actually secondary&mdash;for example, to fix upon the return
to the Middle Ages as the central fact in romanticism,
whereas this return is only symptomatic; it is
very far from being the original phenomenon. Confused
and incomplete definitions of romanticism have
indeed just that origin&mdash;they seek to put at the centre
something that though romantic is not central but
peripheral, and so the whole subject is thrown out of
perspective.</p>

<p>My plan then is to determine to the best of my ability,
in connection with a brief historical survey, the common
element in the various uses of the words classic and
romantic; and then, having thus disposed of the similarities,
to turn to the second part of the art of defining and
deal, also historically, with the differences. For my subject
is not romanticism in general, but only a particular
type of romanticism, and this type of romanticism needs
to be seen as a recoil, not from classicism in general, but
from a particular type of classicism.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The word romantic when traced historically is found
to go back to the old French <i>roman</i> of which still elder
forms are <i>romans</i> and <i>romant</i>. These and similar formations
derive ultimately from the mediæval Latin adverb
<i>romanice</i>. <i>Roman</i> and like words meant originally the
various vernaculars derived from Latin, just as the
French still speak of these vernaculars as <i>les langues romanes</i>;
and then the word <i>roman</i> came to be applied to
tales written in the various vernaculars, especially in
old French. Now with what features of these tales
were people most struck? The reply to this question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
is found in a passage of a fifteenth-century Latin manuscript:<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
“From the reading of certain romantics, that is,
books of poetry composed in French on military deeds
which are for the most part fictitious.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Here the term
romantic is applied to books that we should still call
romantic and for the very same reason, namely, because
of the predominance in these books of the element of
fiction over reality.</p>

<p>In general a thing is romantic when, as Aristotle
would say, it is wonderful rather than probable; in
other words, when it violates the normal sequence of
cause and effect in favor of adventure. Here is the fundamental
contrast between the words classic and romantic
which meets us at the outset and in some form
or other persists in all the uses of the word down to the
present day. A thing is romantic when it is strange, unexpected,
intense, superlative, extreme, unique,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> etc. A
thing is classical, on the other hand, when it is not unique,
but representative of a class. In this sense medical men
may speak correctly of a classic case of typhoid fever, or
a classic case of hysteria. One is even justified in speaking
of a classic example of romanticism. By an easy extension
of meaning a thing is classical when it belongs
to a high class or to the best class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The type of romanticism referred to in the fifteenth-century
manuscript was, it will be observed, the spontaneous
product of the popular imagination of the Middle
Ages. We may go further and say that the uncultivated
human imagination in all times and places is romantic in
the same way. It hungers for the thrilling and the marvellous
and is, in short, incurably melodramatic. All students
of the past know how, when the popular imagination is
left free to work on actual historical characters and
events, it quickly introduces into these characters and
events the themes of universal folk-lore, and makes a
ruthless sacrifice of reality to the love of melodramatic
surprise. For example, the original nucleus of historical
fact has almost disappeared in the lurid melodramatic
tale “Les quatre fils Aymon,” which has continued, as
presented in the “Bibliothèque Bleue,” to appeal to the
French peasant down to our own times. Those who look
with alarm on recent attacks upon romanticism should
therefore be comforted. All children, nearly all women
and the vast majority of men always have been, are and
probably always will be romantic. This is true even of a
classical period like the second half of the seventeenth
century in France. Boileau is supposed to have killed the
vogue of the interminable romances of the early seventeenth
century which themselves continue the spirit
of the mediæval romances. But recent investigations
have shown that the vogue of these romances continued
until well on into the eighteenth century. They influenced
the imagination of Rousseau, the great modern
romancer.</p>

<p>But to return to the history of the word romantic.
The first printed examples of the word in any modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
tongue are, it would seem, to be found in English. The
Oxford Dictionary cites the following from F. Greville’s
“Life of Sidney” (written before 1628, published in
1652): “Doe not his Arcadian romantics live after him?”&mdash;meaning
apparently ideas or features suggestive of
romance. Of extreme interest is the use of the word in
Evelyn’s “Diary” (3 August, 1654): “Were Sir Guy’s
grot improved as it might be, it were capable of being
made a most romantic and pleasant place.” The word is
not only used in a favorable sense, but it is applied to
nature; and it is this use of the word in connection with
outer nature that French and German literatures are
going to derive later from England. Among the early
English uses of the word romantic may be noted: “There
happened this extraordinary case&mdash;one of the most
romantique that ever I heard in my life and could not
have believed,”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> etc. “Most other authors that I ever
read either have wild romantic tales wherein they strain
Love and Honor to that ridiculous height that it becomes
burlesque,”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> etc. The word becomes fairly common by
the year 1700 and thousands of examples could be collected
from English writers in the eighteenth century.
Here are two early eighteenth-century instances:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The gentleman I am married to made love to me in rapture but
it was the rapture of a Christian and a man of Honor, not a romantic
hero or a whining coxcomb.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Whether the charmer sinner it or saint it</div>
<div class="verse">If folly grow romantick I must paint it.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The early French and German uses of the word romantic
seem to derive from England. One important point is
to be noted as to France. Before using the word <i>romantique</i>
the French used the word <i>romanesque</i> in the sense
of wild, unusual, adventurous&mdash;especially in matters
of sentiment, and they have continued to employ <i>romanesque</i>
alongside <i>romantique</i>, which is now practically used
only of the romantic school. A great deal of confusion
is thus avoided into which we fall in English from having
only the one word romantic, which must do duty for both
<i>romantique</i> and <i>romanesque</i>. An example of <i>romantique</i>
is found in French as early as 1675;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> but the word owed
its vogue practically to the anglomania that set in about
the middle of the eighteenth century. The first very influential
French example of the word is appropriately
found in Rousseau in the Fifth Promenade (1777): “The
shores of the Lake of Bienne are more wild and romantic
than those of the Lake of Geneva.” The word <i>romantique</i>
was fashionable in France especially as applied to scenery
from about the year 1785, but without any thought as
yet of applying it to a literary school.</p>

<p>In Germany the word <i>romantisch</i> as an equivalent of
the French <i>romanesque</i> and modern German <i>romanhaft</i>,
appears at the end of the seventeenth century and plainly
as a borrowing from the French. Heidigger, a Swiss, used
it several times in his “Mythoscopia romantica,”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> an
attack on romances and the wild and vain imaginings
they engender. According to Heidigger the only resource
against romanticism in this sense is religion. In Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
as in France the association of romantic with natural
scenery comes from England, especially from the imitations
and translations of Thomson’s “Seasons.”</p>

<p>In the second half of the eighteenth century the increasingly
favorable use of words like Gothic and enthusiastic
as well as the emergence of words like sentimental
and picturesque are among the symptoms of a
new movement, and the fortunes of the word romantic
were more or less bound up with this movement. Still,
apart from its application to natural scenery, the word
is as yet far from having acquired a favorable connotation
if we are to believe an essay by John Foster on the
“Application of the Epithet Romantic” (1805). Foster’s
point of view is not unlike that of Heidigger. Romantic,
he says, had come to be used as a term of vague abuse,
whereas it can be used rightly only of the ascendancy of
imagination over judgment, and is therefore synonymous
with such words as wild, visionary, extravagant. “A man
possessing so strong a judgment and so subordinate a
fancy as Dean Swift would hardly have been made
romantic … if he had studied all the books in Don
Quixote’s library.” It is not, Foster admits, a sign of
high endowment for a youth to be too coldly judicial, too
deaf to the blandishments of imaginative illusion. Yet
in general a man should strive to bring his imagination
under the control of sound reason. But how is it possible
thus to prevail against the deceits of fancy? Right knowing,
he asserts very un-Socratically, is not enough to
ensure right doing. At this point Foster changes from
the tone of a literary essay to that of a sermon, and,
maintaining a thesis somewhat similar to that of Pascal
in the seventeenth century and Heidigger in the eighteenth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he concludes that a man’s imagination will run
away with his judgment or reason unless he have the aid
of divine grace.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>When Foster wrote his essay there was no question as
yet in England of a romantic school. Before considering
how the word came to be applied to a particular movement
we need first to bring out more fully certain broad
conflicts of tendency during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, conflicts that are not sufficiently revealed
by the occasional uses during this period of the word
romantic. In the contrast Foster established between
judgment and imagination he is merely following a long
series of neo-classical critics and this contrast not only
seemed to him and these critics, but still seems to many,
the essential contrast between classicism and romanticism.
We shall be helped in understanding how judgment
(or reason) and imagination came thus to be sharply contrasted
if we consider briefly the changes in the meaning
of the word wit during the neo-classical period, and also
if we recollect that the contrast between judgment and
imagination is closely related to the contrast the French
are so fond of establishing between the general sense
(<i>le sens commun</i>) and the private sense or sense of the
individual (<i>le sens propre</i>).</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century prime emphasis was put not
upon common sense, but upon wit or conceit or ingenuity
(in the sense of quickness of imagination). The typical
Elizabethan strove to excel less by judgment than by
invention, by “high-flying liberty of conceit”; like Falstaff
he would have a brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> “apprehensive, quick, forgetive,
full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes.” Wit
at this time, it should be remembered, was synonymous
not only with imagination but with intellect (in opposition
to will). The result of the worship of wit in this
twofold sense was a sort of intellectual romanticism.
Though its origins are no doubt mediæval, it differs
from the ordinary romanticism of the Middle Ages to
which I have already referred in being thus concerned
with thought rather than with action. Towards the end
of the Renaissance and in the early seventeenth century
especially, people were ready to pursue the strange
and surprising thought even at the risk of getting too
far away from the workings of the normal mind. Hence
the “points” and “conceits” that spread, as Lowell put
it, like a “cutaneous eruption” over the face of Europe;
hence the Gongorists, and Cultists, the Marinists and
Euphuists, the <i>précieux</i> and the “metaphysical” poets.
And then came the inevitable swing away from all this
fantasticality towards common sense. A demand arose
for something that was less rare and “precious” and
more representative.</p>

<p>This struggle between the general sense and the sense
of the individual stands out with special clearness in
France. A model was gradually worked out by aid of the
classics, especially the Latin classics, as to what man
should be. Those who were in the main movement of the
time elaborated a great convention, that is they <i>came
together</i> about certain things. They condemned in the
name of their convention those who were too indulgent
of their private sense, in other words, too eccentric in
their imaginings. A Théophile, for example, fell into disesteem
for refusing to restrain his imagination, for asserting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the type of “spontaneity” that would have won him
favor in any romantic period.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The swing away from intellectual romanticism can
also be traced in the changes that took place in the meaning
of the word wit in both France and England. One
of the main tasks of the French critics of the seventeenth
century and of English critics, largely under the
lead of the French, was to distinguish between true and
false wit. The work that would have been complimented
a little earlier as “witty” and “conceited” is now censured
as fantastic and far-fetched, as lacking in judicial
control over the imagination, and therefore in general
appeal. The movement away from the sense of the individual
towards common sense goes on steadily from the
time of Malherbe to that of Boileau. Balzac attacks
Ronsard for his individualistic excess, especially for his
audacity in inventing words without reference to usage.
Balzac himself is attacked by Boileau for his affectation,
for his straining to say things differently from
other people. In so far his wit was not true but false.
La Bruyère, in substantial accord with Boileau, defines
false wit as wit which is lacking in good sense and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
judgment and “in which the imagination has too large
a share.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>What the metaphysical poets in England understood
by wit, according to Dr. Johnson, was the pursuit of their
thoughts to their last ramifications, and in this pursuit
of the singular and the novel they lost the “grandeur of
generality.” This imaginative quest of rarity led to the
same recoil as in France, to a demand for common sense
and judgment. The opposite extreme from the metaphysical
excess is reached when the element of invention is
eliminated entirely from wit and it is reduced, as it is by
Pope, to rendering happily the general sense&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">What oft was thought but ne’er so well expressed.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Johnson says that the decisive change in the meaning
of the word wit took place about the time of Cowley.
Important evidences of this change and also of the new
tendency to depreciate the imagination is also found in
certain passages of Hobbes. Hobbes identifies the imagination
with the memory of outer images and so looks on
it as “decaying sense.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> “They who observe similitudes,”
he remarks elsewhere, making a distinction that was to be
developed by Locke and accepted by Addison, “in case
they be such as are but rarely observed by others are said
to have a good wit; by which, in this occasion, is meant a
good fancy” (wit has here the older meaning). “But they
who distinguish and observe differences,” he continues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
“are said to have a good judgment. Fancy without
the help of judgment is not worthy of commendation,
whereas judgment is commended for itself without the
help of fancy. Indeed without steadiness and direction to
some end, a great fancy is one kind of madness.” “Judgment
without fancy,” he concludes, “is wit” (this anticipates
the extreme neo-classical use of the word wit), “but
fancy without judgment, not.”</p>

<p>Dryden betrays the influence of Hobbes when he
says of the period of incubation of his “Rival Ladies”:
“Fancy was yet in its first work, moving the sleeping
images of things towards the light, there to be distinguished
and either chosen or rejected by judgment.”
Fancy or imagination (the words were still synonymous),
as conceived by the English neo-classicists, often shows
a strange vivacity for a faculty that is after all only
“decaying sense.” “Fancy without judgment,” says
Dryden, “is a hot-mouthed jade without a curb.”
“Fancy,” writes Rymer in a similar vein, “leaps and
frisks, and away she’s gone; whilst reason rattles the
chain and follows after.” The following lines of Mulgrave
are typical of the neo-classical notion of the relation
between fancy and judgment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">As all is dullness when the Fancy’s bad,</div>
<div class="verse">So without Judgment, Fancy is but mad.</div>
<div class="verse">Reason is that substantial, useful part</div>
<div class="verse">Which gains the Head, while t’ other wins the Heart.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The opposition established by the neo-classicist in
passages of this kind is too mechanical. Fancy and judgment
do not seem to coöperate but to war with one another.
In case of doubt the neo-classicist is always ready
to sacrifice fancy to the “substantial, useful part,” and
so he seems too negative and cool and prosaic in his
reason, and this is because his reason is so largely a protest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
against a previous romantic excess. What had been
considered genius in the time of the “metaphysicals”
had too often turned out to be only oddity. With this
warning before them men kept their eyes fixed very
closely on the model of normal human nature that had
been set up, and imitated it very literally and timorously.
A man was haunted by the fear that he might be “monstrous,”
and so, as Rymer put it, “satisfy nobody’s maggot
but his own.” Correctness thus became a sort of
tyranny. We suffer to the present day from this neo-classical
failure to work out a sound conception of the
imagination in its relation to good sense. Because the
neo-classicist held the imagination lightly as compared
with good sense the romantic rebels, were led to hold good
sense lightly as compared with imagination. The romantic
view in short is too much the neo-classical view turned
upside down; and, as Sainte-Beuve says, nothing resembles
a hollow so much as a swelling.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Because the classicism against which romanticism rebelled
was inadequate it does not follow that every type
of classicism suffers from a similar inadequacy. The great
movement away from imaginative unrestraint towards
regularity and good sense took place in the main under
French auspices. In general the French have been the
chief exponents of the classic spirit in modern times.
They themselves feel this so strongly that a certain group
in France has of late years inclined to use interchangeably
the words classicist and nationalist. But this is a grave
confusion, for if the classic spirit is anything at all it is in
its essence not local and national, but universal and human.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
To be sure, any particular manifestation of classicism
will of necessity contain elements that are less
universal, elements that reflect merely a certain person or
persons, or a certain age and country. This is a truth that
we scarcely need to have preached to us; for with the
growth of the historical method we have come to fix our
attention almost exclusively on these local and relative
elements. The complete critic will accept the historical
method but be on his guard against its excess. He will
see an element in man that is set above the local and
the relative; he will learn to detect this abiding element
through all the flux of circumstance; in Platonic language,
he will perceive the One in the Many.</p>

<p>Formerly, it must be admitted, critics were not historical
enough. They took to be of the essence of classicism
what was merely its local coloring, especially the coloring
it received from the French of the seventeenth century.
If we wish to distinguish between essence and accident
in the classic spirit we must get behind the French of the
seventeenth century, behind the Italians of the sixteenth
century who laid the foundations of neo-classical theory,
behind the Romans who were the immediate models of
most neo-classicists, to the source of classicism in Greece.
Even in Greece the classic spirit is very much implicated
in the local and the relative, yet in the life of no other
people perhaps does what is universal in man shine forth
more clearly from what is only local and relative. We
still need, therefore, to return to Greece, not merely for
the best practice, but for the best theory of classicism; for
this is still found in spite of all its obscurities and incompleteness
in the Poetics of Aristotle. If we have recourse
to this treatise, however, it must be on condition that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
do not, like the critics of the Renaissance, deal with it in
an abstract and dogmatic way (the form of the treatise it
must be confessed gave them no slight encouragement),
but in a spirit akin to Aristotle’s own as revealed in the
total body of his writings&mdash;a spirit that is at its best
positive and experimental.</p>

<p>Aristotle not only deals positively and experimentally
with the natural order and with man so far as he is a part
of this order, but he deals in a similar fashion with a side
of man that the modern positivist often overlooks. Like
all the great Greeks Aristotle recognizes that man is the
creature of two laws: he has an ordinary or natural self
of impulse and desire and a human self that is known practically
as a power of control over impulse and desire. If
man is to become human he must not let impulse and
desire run wild, but must oppose to everything excessive
in his ordinary self, whether in thought or deed or emotion,
the law of measure. This insistence on restraint and
proportion is rightly taken to be of the essence not merely
of the Greek spirit but of the classical spirit in general.
The norm or standard that is to set bounds to the ordinary
self is got at by different types of classicists in different
ways and described variously: for example, as the
human law, or the better self, or reason (a word to be discussed
more fully later), or nature. Thus when Boileau
says, “Let nature be your only study,” he does not mean
outer nature, nor again the nature of this or that individual,
but representative human nature. Having decided
what is normal either for man or some particular class of
men the classicist takes this normal “nature” for his
model and proceeds to imitate it. Whatever accords with
the model he has thus set up he pronounces natural or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
probable, whatever on the other hand departs too far
from what he conceives to be the normal type or the
normal sequence of cause and effect he holds to be “improbable”
and unnatural or even, if it attains an extreme
of abnormality, “monstrous.” Whatever in conduct or
character is duly restrained and proportionate with reference
to the model is said to observe decorum. Probability
and decorum are identical in some of their aspects and
closely related in all.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> To recapitulate, a general nature,
a core of normal experience, is affirmed by all classicists.
From this central affirmation derives the doctrine of imitation,
and from imitation in turn the doctrines of probability
and decorum.</p>

<p>But though all classicists are alike in insisting on
nature, imitation, probability and decorum, they differ
widely, as I have already intimated, in what they understand
by these terms. Let us consider first what Aristotle
and the Greeks understand by them. The first point to
observe is that according to Aristotle one is to get his
general nature not on authority or second hand, but is
to disengage it directly for himself from the jumble of
particulars that he has before his eyes. He is not, says
Aristotle, to imitate things as they are, but as they ought
to be. Thus conceived imitation is a creative act. Through
all the welter of the actual one penetrates to the real and
so succeeds without ceasing to be individual in suggesting
the universal. Poetry that is imitative in this sense is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
according to Aristotle, more “serious” and “philosophical”
than history. History deals merely with what has
happened, whereas poetry deals with what may happen
according to probability or necessity. Poetry, that is, does
not portray life literally but extricates the deeper or ideal
truth from the flux of circumstance. One may add with
Sydney that if poetry is thus superior to history in being
more serious and philosophical it resembles history and is
superior to philosophy in being concrete.</p>

<p>The One that the great poet or artist perceives in the
Many and that gives to his work its high seriousness is
not a fixed absolute. In general the model that the highly
serious man (ὁ σπουδαῖος) imitates and that keeps his ordinary
self within the bounds of decorum is not to be
taken as anything finite, as anything that can be formulated
once for all. This point is important for on it hinges
every right distinction not merely between the classic
and the romantic, but between the classic and the pseudo-classic.
Romanticism has claimed for itself a monopoly
of imagination and infinitude, but on closer examination,
as I hope to show later, this claim, at least so far as genuine
classicism is concerned, will be found to be quite
unjustified. For the present it is enough to say that true
classicism does not rest on the observance of rules or the
imitation of models but on an immediate insight into the
universal. Aristotle is especially admirable in the account
he gives of this insight and of the way it may manifest
itself in art and literature. One may be rightly imitative,
he says, and so have access to a superior truth and give
others access to it only by being a master of illusion.
Though the great poet “breathes immortal air,” though
he sees behind the shows of sense a world of more abiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
relationships, he can convey his vision not directly but
only imaginatively. Aristotle, one should observe, does
not establish any hard and fast opposition between judgment
and imagination, an opposition that pervades not
only the neo-classical movement but also the romantic
revolt from it. He simply affirms a supersensuous order
which one can perceive only with the help of fiction. The
best art, says Goethe in the true spirit of Aristotle, gives
us the “illusion of a higher reality.” This has the advantage
of being experimental. It is merely a statement of
what one feels in the presence of a great painting, let us
say, or in reading a great poem.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>After this attempt to define briefly with the help of the
Greeks the classical spirit in its essence we should be prepared
to understand more clearly the way in which this
spirit was modified in neo-classical times, especially in
France. The first thing that strikes one about the classicism
of this period is that it does not rest on immediate
perception like that of the Greeks but on outer authority.
The merely dogmatic and traditional classicist gave a
somewhat un-Greek meaning to the doctrines of nature
and imitation. Why imitate nature directly, said Scaliger,
when we have in Virgil a second nature? Imitation thus
came to mean the imitation of certain outer models and
the following of rules based on these models. Now it is
well that one who aims at excellence in any field should
begin by a thorough assimilation of the achievements of
his great predecessors in this field. Unfortunately the neo-classical
theorist tended to impose a multitude of precepts
that were based on what was external rather than on what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was vital in the practice of his models. In so far the lesson
of form that the great ancients can always teach any one
who approaches them in the right spirit degenerated into
formalism. This formalistic turn given to the doctrine of
imitation was felt from the outset to be a menace to originality;
to be incompatible, and everything hinges at last
on this point, with the spontaneity of the imagination.
There was an important reaction headed by men like
Boileau, within the neo-classical movement itself, against
the oppression of the intuitive side of human nature by
mere dogma and authority, above all against the notion
that “regularity” is in itself any guarantee of literary
excellence. A school of rules was succeeded by a school of
taste. Yet even to the end the neo-classicist was too prone
to reject as unnatural or even monstrous everything that
did not fit into one of the traditional pigeon-holes. One
must grant, indeed, that much noble work was achieved
under the neo-classical dispensation, work that shows a
genuine insight into the universal, but it is none the less
evident that the view of the imagination held during this
period has a formalistic taint.</p>

<p>This taint in neo-classicism is due not merely to its dogmatic
and mechanical way of dealing with the doctrine
of imitation but also to the fact that it had to reconcile
classical with Christian dogma; and the two antiquities,
classical and Christian, if interpreted vitally and in
the spirit, were in many respects divergent and in some
respects contradictory. The general outcome of the attempts
at reconciliation made by the literary casuists
of Italy and France was that Christianity should have a
monopoly of truth and classicism a monopoly of fiction.
For the true classicist, it will be remembered, the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
things are inseparable&mdash;he gets at his truth through a
veil of fiction. Many of the neo-classicists came to conceive
of art as many romanticists were to conceive of it
later as a sort of irresponsible game or play, but they were,
it must be confessed, very inferior to the romanticists in
the spontaneity of their fiction. They went for this fiction
as for everything else to the models, and this meant in
practice that they employed the pagan myths, not as
imaginative symbols of a higher reality&mdash;it is still possible
to employ them in that way&mdash;but merely in Boileau’s
phrase as “traditional ornaments” (<i>ornements reçus</i>).
The neo-classicist to be sure might so employ his
“fiction” as to inculcate a moral; in that case he is only
too likely to give us instead of the living symbol, dead
allegory; instead of high seriousness, its caricature, didacticism.
The traditional stock of fiction became at
last so intolerably trite as to be rejected even by some of
the late neo-classicists. “The rejection and contempt of
fiction,” said Dr. Johnson (who indulged in it himself on
occasion) “is rational and manly.” But to reject fiction
in the larger sense is to miss the true driving power in
human nature&mdash;the imagination. Before concluding,
however, that Dr. Johnson had no notion of the rôle of
the imagination one should read his attack on the theory
of the three unities<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which was later to be turned to account
by the romanticists.</p>

<p>Now the three unities may be defended on an entirely
legitimate ground&mdash;on the ground namely that they
make for concentration, a prime virtue in the drama;
but the grounds on which they were actually imposed
on the drama, especially in connection with the Quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of the Cid, illustrate the corruption of another main
classical doctrine, that of probability or verisimilitude.
In his dealings with probability as in his dealings with
imitation, the neo-classical formalist did not allow sufficiently
for the element of illusion. What he required
from the drama in the name of probability was not the
“illusion of a higher reality,” but strict logic or even literal
deception. He was not capable of a poetic faith, not
willing to suspend his disbelief on passing from the world
of ordinary fact to the world of artistic creation. Goethe
was thinking especially of the neo-classical French when
he said: “As for the French, they will always be arrested
by their reason. They do not recognize that the imagination
has its own laws which are and always must be
problematic for the reason.”</p>

<p>It was also largely under French influence that the
doctrine of decorum, which touches probability at many
points, was turned aside from its true meaning. Decorum
is in a way the peculiar doctrine of the classicist, is in
Milton’s phrase “the grand masterpiece to observe.” The
doctrines of the universal and the imitation of the universal
go deeper indeed than decorum, so much deeper
that they are shared by classicism with religion. The man
who aspires to live religiously must no less than the
humanist look to some model set above his ordinary self
and imitate it. But though the classicist at his best meditates,
he does not, like the seeker after religious perfection,
see in meditation an end in itself but rather a support
for the mediatory virtues, the virtues of the man
who would live to the best advantage in this world rather
than renounce it; and these virtues may be said to be
summed up in decorum. For the best type of Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
humanist, a Sophocles let us say, decorum was a vital
and immediate thing. But there enters into decorum even
from the time of the Alexandrian Greeks, and still more
into French neo-classical decorum, a marked element of
artificiality. The all-roundness and fine symmetry, the
poise and dignity that come from working within the
bounds of the human law, were taken to be the privilege
not of man in general but of a special social class. Take
for instance verbal decorum: the French neo-classicists
assumed that if the speech of poetry is to be noble and
highly serious it must coincide with the speech of the
aristocracy. As Nisard puts it, they confused nobility of
language with the language of the nobility. Decorum
was thus more or less merged with etiquette, so that the
standards of the stage and of literature in general came
to coincide, as Rousseau complains, with those of the
drawing-room. More than anything else this narrowing
of decorum marks the decline from the classic to the
pseudo-classic, from form to formalism.</p>

<p>While condemning pseudo-decorum one should remember
that even a Greek would have seen something paradoxical
in a poem like Goethe’s “Hermann und Dorothea”
and its attempt to invest with epic grandeur the
affairs of villagers and peasants. After all, dignity and
elevation and especially the opportunity for important
action, which is the point on which the classicist puts
prime emphasis, are normally though not invariably
associated with a high rather than with a mean social
estate. In general one should insist that the decorum
worked out under French auspices was far from being
merely artificial. The French gentleman (<i>honnête homme</i>)
of the seventeenth century often showed a moderation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and freedom from over-emphasis, an exquisite tact and
urbanity that did not fall too far short of his immediate
model, Horace, and related him to the all-round man
of the Greeks (καλὸς κἀγαθός). To be sure an ascetic
Christian like Pascal sees in decorum a disguise of one’s
ordinary self rather than a real curb upon it, and feels
that the gap is not sufficiently wide between even the
best type of the man of the world and the mere worldling.
One needs, however, to be very austere to disdain the art
of living that has been fostered by decorum from the
Greeks down. Something of this art of living survives
even in a Chesterfield, who falls far short of the best
type of French gentleman and reminds one very remotely
indeed of a Pericles. Chesterfield’s half-jesting definition
of decorum as the art of combining the useful appearances
of virtue with the solid satisfactions of vice points the
way to its ultimate corruption. Talleyrand, who marks
perhaps this last stage, was defined by Napoleon as “a
silk stocking filled with mud.” In some of its late exemplars
decorum had actually become, as Rousseau complains,
the “mask of hypocrisy” and the “varnish of
vice.”</p>

<p>One should not however, like Rousseau and the romanticists,
judge of decorum by what it degenerated into.
Every doctrine of genuine worth is disciplinary and
men in the mass do not desire discipline. “Most men,”
says Aristotle, “would rather live in a disorderly than
in a sober manner.” But most men do not admit any
such preference&mdash;that would be crude and inartistic.
They incline rather to substitute for the reality of discipline
some art of going through the motions. Every
great doctrine is thus in constant peril of passing over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
into some hollow semblance or even, it may be, into some
mere caricature of itself. When one wishes therefore to
determine the nature of decorum one should think of a
Milton, let us say, and not of a Talleyrand or even of
a Chesterfield.</p>

<p>Milton imitated the models, like any other neo-classicist,
but his imitation was not, in Joubert’s phrase, that
of one book by another book, but of one soul by another
soul. His decorum is therefore imaginative; and it is the
privilege of the imagination to give the sense of spaciousness
and infinitude. On the other hand, the unimaginative
way in which many of the neo-classicists held their main
tenets&mdash;nature, imitation, probability, decorum&mdash;narrowed
unduly the scope of the human spirit and appeared
to close the gates of the future. “Art and diligence have
now done their best,” says Dr. Johnson of the versification
of Pope, “and what shall be added will be the effort
of tedious toil and needless curiosity.” Nothing is more
perilous than thus to seem to confine man in some pinfold;
there is something in him that refuses to acquiesce
in any position as final; he is in Nietzsche’s phrase the
being who must always surpass himself. The attempt to
oppose external and mechanical barriers to the freedom
of the spirit will create in the long run an atmosphere of
stuffiness and smugness, and nothing is more intolerable
than smugness. Men were guillotined in the French
Revolution, as Bagehot suggests, simply because either
they or their ancestors had been smug. Inert acceptance
of tradition and routine will be met sooner or later by the
cry of Faust: <i>Hinaus ins Freie!</i></p>

<p>Before considering the value of the method chosen
by Rousseau and the romanticists for breaking up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
“tiresome old heavens” and escaping from smugness
and stuffiness, one should note that the lack of originality
and genius which they lamented in the eighteenth century&mdash;especially
in that part of it known as the Enlightenment&mdash;was
not due entirely to pseudo-classic formalism.
At least two other main currents entered into the
Enlightenment: first the empirical and utilitarian current
that goes back to Francis Bacon, and some would say to
Roger Bacon; and secondly the rationalistic current that
goes back to Descartes. English empiricism gained international
vogue in the philosophy of Locke, and Locke
denies any supersensuous element in human nature to
which one may have access with the aid of the imagination
or in any other way. Locke’s method of precise naturalistic
observation is in itself legitimate; for man is plainly
subject to the natural law. What is not truly empirical
is to bring the whole of human nature under this law.
One can do this only by piecing out precise observation
and experiment with dogmatic rationalism. One side of
Locke may therefore be properly associated with the
father of modern rationalists, Descartes. The attempt
of the rationalist to lock up life in some set of formulæ
produces in the imaginative man a feeling of oppression.
He gasps for light and air. The very tracing of cause and
effect and in general the use of the analytical faculties&mdash;and
this is to fly to the opposite extreme&mdash;came to be
condemned by the romanticists as inimical to the imagination.
Not only do they make endless attacks on Locke,
but at times they assail even Newton for having mechanized
life, though Newton’s comparison of himself to a
child picking up pebbles on the seashore would seem to
show that he had experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> “the feeling infinite.”</p>

<p>The elaboration of science into a closed system with the
aid of logic and pure mathematics is as a matter of fact
to be associated with Descartes rather than with Newton.
Neither Newton nor Descartes, one scarcely needs add,
wished to subject man entirely to the natural law and the
nexus of physical causes; they were not in short determinists.
Yet the superficial rationalism of the Enlightenment
was in the main of Cartesian origin. This Cartesian
influence ramifies in so many directions and is related at
so many points to the literary movement, and there has
been so much confusion about this relationship, that we
need to pause here to make a few distinctions.</p>

<p>Perhaps what most strikes one in the philosophy of
Descartes is its faith in logic and abstract reasoning and
the closely allied processes of mathematical demonstration.
Anything that is not susceptible of clear proof in this
logical and almost mathematical sense is to be rejected.
Now this Cartesian notion of clearness is fatal to a true
classicism. The higher reality, the true classicist maintains,
cannot be thus demonstrated; it can only be
grasped, and then never completely, through a veil of
imaginative illusion. Boileau is reported to have said that
Descartes had cut the throat of poetry; and this charge
is justified in so far as the Cartesian requires from poetry
a merely logical clearness. This conception of clearness
was also a menace to the classicism of the seventeenth
century which rested in the final analysis not on logic
but on tradition. This appeared very clearly in the early
phases of the quarrel between ancients and moderns
when literary Cartesians like Perrault and Fontenelle
attacked classical dogma in the name of reason. In fact
one may ask if any doctrine has ever appeared so fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to every form of tradition&mdash;not merely literary but
also religious and political&mdash;as Cartesianism. The rationalist
of the eighteenth century was for dismissing
as “prejudice” everything that could not give a clear
account of itself in the Cartesian sense. This riot of
abstract reasoning (<i>la raison raisonnante</i>) that prepared
the way for the Revolution has been identified by Taine
and others with the classic spirit. A more vicious confusion
has seldom gained currency in criticism. It is true
that the French have mixed a great deal of logic with
their conception of the classic spirit, but that is because
they have mixed a great deal of logic with everything.
I have already mentioned their tendency to substitute
a logical for an imaginative verisimilitude; and strenuously
logical classicists may be found in France from
Chapelain to Brunetière. Yet the distinction that should
keep us from confusing mere logic with the classic spirit
was made by a Frenchman who was himself violently
logical and also a great geometrician&mdash;Pascal. One
should keep distinct, says Pascal, the <i>esprit de géométrie</i>
and the <i>esprit de finesse</i>. The <i>esprit de finesse</i> is not, like
the <i>esprit de géométrie</i>, abstract, but very concrete.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> So
far as a man possesses the <i>esprit de finesse</i> he is enabled
to judge correctly of the ordinary facts of life and of the
relationships between man and man. But these judgments
rest upon such a multitude of delicate perceptions that
he is frequently unable to account for them logically.
It is to intuitive good sense and not to the <i>esprit de
géométrie</i> that the gentleman (<i>honnête homme</i>) of the neo-classical
period owed his fine tact. Pascal himself finally
took a stand against reason as understood both by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Cartesian and by the man of the world. Unaided reason
he held is unable to prevail against the deceits of the
imagination; it needs the support of intuition&mdash;an
intuition that he identifies with grace, thus making it
inseparable from the most austere form of Christianity.
The “heart,” he says, and this is the name he gives to
intuition, “has reasons of which the reason knows nothing.”
A Plato or an Aristotle would not have understood
this divorce between reason and intuition.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Pascal seems to get his insight only by flouting ordinary
good sense. He identifies this insight with a type of
theological dogma of which good sense was determined
to be rid; and so it tended to get rid of the insight along
with the dogma. Classical dogma also seemed at times
to be in opposition to the intuitive good sense of the man
of the world. The man of the world therefore often inclined
to assail both the classical and the Christian tradition
in the name of good sense, just as the Cartesian
inclined to assail these traditions in the name of abstract
reason. Perhaps the best exponent of anti-traditional
good sense in the seventeenth century was Molière. He
vindicated nature, and by nature he still meant in the
main normal human nature, from arbitrary constraints
of every kind whether imposed by an ascetic Christianity
or by a narrow and pedantic classicism. Unfortunately
Molière is too much on the side of the opposition. He does
not seem to put his good sense into the service of some
positive insight of his own. Good sense may be of many
degrees according to the order of facts of which it has a
correct perception. The order of facts in human nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that Molière’s good sense perceived is not the highest and
so this good sense appears at times too ready to justify
the bourgeois against the man who has less timid and
conventional views. So at least Rousseau thought when
he made his famous attack on Molière.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Rousseau assailed
Molière in the name of instinct as Pascal would
have assailed him in the name of insight, and fought
sense with sensibility. The hostility of Rousseau to Molière,
according to M. Faguet, is that of a romantic
Bohemian to a philistine of genius.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> One hesitates to
call Molière a philistine, but one may at least grant M.
Faguet that Molière’s good sense is not always sufficiently
inspired.</p>

<p>I have been trying to build up a background that will
make clear why the reason of the eighteenth century
(whether we understand by reason logic or good sense)
had come to be superficial and therefore oppressive to
the imagination. It is only with reference to this “reason”
that one can understand the romantic revolt. But neo-classical
reason itself can be understood only with reference
to its background&mdash;as a recoil namely from a previous
romantic excess. This excess was manifested not
only in the intellectual romanticism of which I have already
spoken, but in the cult of the romantic deed that
had flourished in the Middle Ages. This cult and the literature
that reflected it continued to appeal, even to the
cultivated, well on into the neo-classical period. It was
therefore felt necessary to frame a definition of reason
that should be a rebuke to the extravagance and improbability
of the mediæval romances. When men became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
conscious in the eighteenth century of the neo-classical
meagerness on the imaginative side they began to look
back with a certain envy to the free efflorescence of fiction
in the Middle Ages. They began to ask themselves with
Hurd whether the reason and correctness they had won
were worth the sacrifice of a “world of fine fabling.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
We must not, however, like Heine and many others,
look on the romantic movement as merely a return
to the Middle Ages. We have seen that the men of the
Middle Ages themselves understood by romance not simply
their own kind of speech and writing in contrast with
what was written in Latin, but a kind of writing in
which the pursuit of strangeness and adventure predominated.
This pursuit of strangeness and adventure
will be found to predominate in all types of romanticism.
The type of romanticism, however, which came
in towards the end of the eighteenth century did not,
even when professedly mediæval, simply revert to the
older types. It was primarily not a romanticism of
thought or of action, the types we have encountered thus
far, but a romanticism of feeling. The beginnings of this
emotional romanticism antedate considerably the application
of the word romantic to a particular literary
school. Before considering how the word came to be thus
applied we shall need to take a glance at eighteenth-century
sentimentalism, especially at the plea for genius and
originality that, from about the middle of the century
on, were opposed to the tameness and servile imitation
of the neo-classicists.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">ROMANTIC GENIUS</span></h2>

<p>Romanticism, it has been remarked, is all that is not
Voltaire. The clash between Rousseau and Voltaire is
indeed not merely the clash between two men, it is the
clash between two incompatible views of life. Voltaire
is the end of the old world, as Goethe has put it, Rousseau
the beginning of the new.</p>

<p>One is not to suppose, however, that Voltaire was a
consistent champion of the past. He is indeed with all his
superficial clearness one of the most incoherent of writers.
At the same time that he defended classical tradition he
attacked Christian tradition, spreading abroad a spirit
of mockery and irreverence that tended to make every
traditional belief impossible. The “reason” to which he
appeals has all the shallowness that I have noticed in the
“reason” of the eighteenth century. Though he does not
fall into the Cartesian excess of abstract reasoning, and
though the good sense that he most often understands
by reason is admirably shrewd within certain bounds, he
nevertheless falls very far short of the standards of a true
classicism. He delights in the philosophy of Locke and has
little sense for Greek philosophy or for the higher aspects
of Greek literature. He is quite lacking in the quality
of imagination that is needful if one is to communicate
with what is above the ordinary rational level. So far from
being capable of high seriousness, he is scarcely capable
of ordinary seriousness. And so the nobility, elegance,
imitation, and decorum that he is constantly preaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
have about them a taint of formalism. Perhaps this taint
appears most conspicuously in his conception of decorum.
A man may be willing to impose restrictions on his ordinary
self&mdash;and every type of decorum is restrictive&mdash;if
he is asked to do so for some adequate end. The end of the
decorum that an Aristotle, for example, would impose is
that one may become more human and therefore, as he
endeavors to show in a highly positive fashion, happier.
The only art and literature that will please a man who
has thus become human through the observance of true
decorum is an art and literature that are themselves
human and decorous. Voltaire for his part wishes to subject
art and literature to an elaborate set of restrictions
in the name of decorum, but these restrictions are not
joined to any adequate end. The only reward he holds
out to those who observe all these restrictions is “the
merit of difficulty overcome.” At bottom, like so many
of the Jesuits from whom he received his education, he
looks upon art as a game&mdash;a very ingenious and complicated
game. The French muse he compares to a person
executing a difficult clog dance on a tight rope, and he
argues from this comparison, not that the French muse
should assume a less constrained posture, but that she
should on the contrary be exemplary to the nations. No
wonder the romanticists and even Dr. Johnson demurred
at Voltaire’s condemnation of Shakespeare in the name
of this type of decorum.</p>

<p>Voltaire is therefore, in spite of all his dazzling gifts,
one of the most compromising advocates of classicism.
Pope also had eminent merits, but from the truly classical
point of view he is about as inadequate as Voltaire; and
this is important to remember because English romanticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
tends to be all that is not Pope. The English
romanticists revolted especially from the poetic diction
of which Pope was one of the chief sources, and poetic
diction, with its failure to distinguish between nobility
of language and the language of the nobility, is only an
aspect of artificial decorum. However, the revolt from
poetic diction and decorum in general is not the central
aspect of the great movement that resulted in the eclipse
of the wit and man of the world and in the emergence of
the original genius. What the genius wanted was spontaneity,
and spontaneity, as he understood it, involves
a denial, not merely of decorum, but of something that,
as I have said, goes deeper than decorum&mdash;namely the
doctrine of imitation. According to Voltaire genius is
only judicious imitation. According to Rousseau the
prime mark of genius is refusal to imitate. The movement
away from imitation, however, had already got
well started before it thus came to a picturesque head
in the clash between Rousseau and Voltaire, and if we
wish to understand this movement we need to take a
glance at its beginnings&mdash;especially in England.</p>

<p>There are reasons why this supposed opposition between
imitation and genius should have been felt in
England more keenly than elsewhere. The doctrine of
imitation in its neo-classical form did not get established
there until about the time of Dryden. In the meanwhile
England had had a great creative literature in which the
freedom and spontaneity of the imagination had not been
cramped by a too strict imitation of models. Dryden himself,
though he was doing more than any one else to promote
the new correctness that was coming in from France,
felt that this correctness was no equivalent for the Elizabethan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
inspiration. The structure that he and his contemporaries
were erecting might be more regular, but
lacked the boldness and originality of that reared by the
“giant race before the flood”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Our age was cultivated thus at length;</div>
<div class="verse">But what we gained in skill we lost in strength.</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>This contrast between the imitator and the inspired
original was developed by Addison in a paper (“Spectator,”
160) that was destined to be used against the
very school to which he himself belonged. For Addison
was in his general outlook a somewhat tame Augustan.
Nevertheless he exalts the “natural geniuses” who have
something “nobly wild and extravagant” in them above
the geniuses who have been “refined by conversation, reflection
and the reading of the most polite authors”;
who have “formed themselves by rules and submitted
the greatness of their natural talents to the corrections
and restraints of art.” “The great danger in these latter
kind of geniuses, is lest they cramp their own abilities
too much by imitation, and form themselves altogether
upon models, without giving full play to their own natural
parts. An imitation of the best authors is not to compare
with a good original; and I believe we may observe that
very few writers make an extraordinary figure in the
world, who have not something in their way of thinking
or expressing themselves that is peculiar to them, and
entirely their own.”</p>

<p>Another main influence that was making against the
doctrine of imitation was also largely of English origin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
This was the idea of progress through scientific observation
and experiment. As a result of this type of positivism,
discovery was being added to discovery. Science was
kindling man’s imagination and opening up before him
what he really craves, the vista of an endless advance.
Why should not literature likewise do something new
and original instead of sticking forever in the same rut of
imitation? In its Greek form the doctrine of imitation
was, as I have tried to show, not only flexible and progressive,
but in its own way, positive and experimental.
But in modern times the two main forms of imitation,
the classical and the Christian, have worked within the
limits imposed by tradition and traditional models. The
imitation of models, the Christian imitation of Christ,
let us say, or the classical imitation of Horace, may indeed
be a very vital thing, the imitation of one soul by
another soul; but when carried out in this vital way, the
two main forms of imitation tend to clash, and the compromise
between them, as I have already said, resulted
in a good deal of formalism. By its positive and critical
method science was undermining every traditional belief.
Both the Christian and the classical formalists would
have been the first to deny that the truths of imitation
for which they stood could be divorced from tradition
and likewise put on a positive and critical basis. The fact
is indubitable in any case that the discrediting of tradition
has resulted in a progressive lapse from the religious
and the humanistic to the naturalistic level. An equally
indubitable fact is that scientific or rationalistic naturalism
tended from the early eighteenth century to produce
emotional naturalism, and that both forms of naturalism
were hostile to the doctrine of imitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The trend away from the doctrine of imitation towards
emotional naturalism finds revolutionary expression in
the literary field in such a work as Young’s “Conjectures
on Original Composition” (1759). Addison had asserted,
as we have seen, the superiority of what is original in a
man, of what comes to him spontaneously, over what he
acquires by conscious effort and culture. Young, a personal
friend of Addison’s, develops this contrast between
the “natural” and the “artificial” to its extreme consequences.
“Modern writers,” he says, “have a choice to
make. … They may soar in the regions of liberty, or
move in the soft fetters of easy imitation.” “An original
may be said to be of a vegetable nature; it rises spontaneously
from the vital root of genius; it grows, it is
not made; imitations are often a sort of manufacture,
wrought up by those mechanics, art and labor, out of
preëxistent materials not their own.” “We may as well
grow good by another’s virtue, or fat by another’s food,
as famous by another’s thought.” One evidence that we
are still living in the movement of which Young is one
of the initiators is that his treatise will not only seem
to most of us a very spirited piece of writing&mdash;that it
certainly is&mdash;but doctrinally sound. And yet it is only
one of those documents very frequent in literary history
which lack intrinsic soundness, but which can be explained
if not justified as a recoil from an opposite
extreme. The unsoundness of Young’s work comes out
clearly if one compares it with the treatise on the “Sublime”
attributed to Longinus which is not a mere protest
against a previous excess, but a permanently acceptable
treatment of the same problem of genius and
inspiration. Longinus exalts genius, but is at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
time regardful of culture and tradition, and even emphasizes
the relation between inspiration and the imitation
of models. Young insinuates, on the contrary,
that one is aided in becoming a genius by being brainless
and ignorant. “Some are pupils of nature only, nor
go further to school.” “Many a genius probably there
has been which could neither write nor read.” It follows
almost inevitably from these premises that genius flourishes
most in the primitive ages of society before originality
has been crushed beneath the superincumbent weight
of culture and critics have begun their pernicious activities.
Young did not take this step himself, but it was
promptly taken by others on the publication of the Ossianic
poems (1762). Ossian is at once added to the list
of great originals already enumerated by Addison&mdash;Homer,
Pindar, the patriarchs of the Old Testament and
Shakespeare (whom Young like the later romanticists
opposes to Pope). “Poetry,” says Diderot, summing up
a whole movement, “calls for something enormous, barbaric
and savage.”</p>

<p>This exaltation of the virtues of the primitive ages is
simply the projection into a mythical past of a need that
the man of the eighteenth century feels in the present&mdash;the
need to let himself go. This is what he understands by
his “return to nature.” A whole revolution is implied in
this reinterpretation of the word nature. To follow nature
in the classical sense is to imitate what is normal and
representative in man and so to become decorous. To be
natural in the new sense one must begin by getting rid
of imitation and decorum. Moreover, for the classicist,
nature and reason are synonymous. The primitivist, on
the other hand, means by nature the spontaneous play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of impulse and temperament, and inasmuch as this liberty
is hindered rather than helped by reason, he inclines
to look on reason, not as the equivalent but as the
opposite of nature.</p>

<p>If one is to understand this development, one should
note carefully how certain uses of the word reason, not
merely by the neo-classicists but by the anti-traditionalists,
especially in religion, tended to produce this denial
of reason. It is a curious fact that some of those who were
attacking the Christian religion in the name of reason,
were themselves aware that mere reason, whether one
understood by the word abstract reasoning or uninspired
good sense, does not satisfy, that in the long run man is
driven either to rise higher or to sink lower than reason.
St. Evremond, for example, prays nature to deliver man
from the doubtful middle state in which she has placed
him&mdash;either to “lift him up to angelic radiance,” or else
to “sink him to the instinct of simple animals.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Since
the ascending path, the path that led to angelic radiance,
seemed to involve the acceptance of a mass of obsolete
dogma, man gradually inclined to sink below the rational
level and to seek to recover the “instinct of simple animals.”
Another and still more fundamental fact that
some of the rationalists perceived and that militated
against their own position, is that the dominant element
in man is not reason, but imagination, or if one prefers,
the element of illusion. “Illusion,” said Voltaire himself,
“is the queen of the human heart.” The great achievement
of tradition at its best was to be at once a limit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a support to both reason and imagination and so to unite
them in a common allegiance. In the new movement, at
the same time that reason was being encouraged by scientific
method to rise up in revolt against tradition, imagination
was being fascinated and drawn to the naturalistic
level by scientific discovery and the vista of an endless
advance that it opened up. A main problem, therefore,
for the student of this movement is to determine what
forms of imaginative activity are possible on the naturalistic
level. A sort of understanding was reached on this
point by different types of naturalists in the course of
the eighteenth century. One form of imagination, it was
agreed, should be displayed in science, another form in
art and literature.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The scientific imagination should be
controlled by judgment and work in strict subordination
to the facts. In art and literature, on the other hand, the
imagination should be free. Genius and originality are
indeed in strict ratio to this freedom. “In the fairy land
of fancy,” says Young, “genius may wander wild; there
it has a creative power, and may reign arbitrarily over its
own empire of chimeras.” (The empire of chimeras was
later to become the tower of ivory.) This sheer indiscipline
of the literary imagination might seem in contrast
with the discipline of the scientific imagination an inferiority;
but such was not the view of the partisans of
original genius. Kant, indeed, who was strongly influenced
in his “Critique of Æsthetic Judgment” by these
English theorists,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> inclined to deny genius to the man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
science for the very reason that his imagination is so
strictly controlled. The fact would seem to be that a
great scientist, a Newton let us say, has as much right
to be accounted a genius as Shakespeare. The inferiority
of the genius of a Newton compared with that of a
Shakespeare lies in a certain coldness. Scientific genius is
thus cold because it operates in a region less relevant
to man than poetic genius; it is, in Bagehot’s phrase,
more remote from the “hearth of the soul.”</p>

<p>The scientific and the literary imagination are indeed
not quite so sharply contrasted by most of the theorists
as might be inferred from what I have said; most of them
do not admit that the literary imagination should be
entirely free to wander in its own “empire of chimeras.”
Even literary imagination, they maintain, should in some
measure be under the surveillance of judgment or taste.
One should observe, however, that the judgment or taste
that is supposed to control or restrict genius is not associated
with the imagination. On the contrary, imagination
is associated entirely with the element of novelty in
things, which means, in the literary domain, with the
expansive eagerness of a man to get his own uniqueness
uttered. The genius for the Greek, let us remind ourselves,
was not the man who was in this sense unique, but the man
who perceived the universal; and as the universal can be
perceived only with the aid of the imagination, it follows
that genius may be defined as imaginative perception of
the universal. The universal thus conceived not only gives
a centre and purpose to the activity of the imagination,
but sets bounds to the free expansion of temperament
and impulse, to what came to be known in the eighteenth
century as nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Kant, who denies genius to the man of science on
grounds I have already mentioned, is unable to associate
genius in art or literature with this strict discipline of the
imagination to a purpose. The imagination must be free
and must, he holds, show this freedom not by working
but by playing. At the same time Kant had the
cool temper of a man of the Enlightenment, and looked
with the utmost disapproval on the aberrations that had
marked in Germany the age of original genius (<i>die Geniezeit</i>).
He was not in the new sense of the word nor indeed
in any sense, an enthusiast. And so he wished the reason,
or judgment, to keep control over the imagination without
disturbing its free play; art is to have a purpose which
is at the same time not a purpose. The distinctions by
which he works out the supposed relationship between
judgment and imagination are at once difficult and unreal.
One can indeed put one’s finger here more readily
perhaps than elsewhere on the central impotence of
the whole Kantian system. Once discredit tradition and
outer authority and then set up as a substitute a reason
that is divorced from the imagination and so lacks the
support of supersensuous insight, and reason will prove
unable to maintain its hegemony. When the imagination
has ceased to pull in accord with the reason in the service
of a reality that is set above them both, it is sure to
become the accomplice of expansive impulse, and mere
reason is not strong enough to prevail over this union of
imagination and desire. Reason needs some driving power
behind it, a driving power that, when working in alliance
with the imagination, it gets from insight. To suppose
that man will long rest content with mere naked reason
as his guide is to forget that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> “illusion is the queen of the
human heart”; it is to revive the stoical error. Schiller,
himself a Kantian, felt this rationalistic rigor and coldness
of his master, and so sought, while retaining the play
theory of art, to put behind the cold reason of Kant the
driving power it lacked; for this driving power he looked
not to a supersensuous reality, not to insight in short,
but to emotion. He takes appropriately the motto for his
“Æsthetic Letters” from Rousseau: <i>Si c’est la raison qui
fait l’homme, c’est le sentiment qui le conduit</i>. He retains
Kant’s play theory of art without even so much offset
to this play as is implied in Kant’s “purposiveness without
purpose.” The nobility of Schiller’s intentions is beyond
question. At the same time, by encouraging the
notion that it is possible to escape from neo-classical
didacticism only by eliminating masculine purpose from
art, he opens the way for the worst perversions of the
æsthete, above all for the divorce of art from ethical
reality. In art, according to Schiller, both imagination
and feeling should be free and spontaneous, and the
result of all this freedom, as he sees it, will be perfectly
“ideal.” His suspicion of a purpose is invincible. As soon
as anything has a purpose it ceases to be æsthetic and
in the same measure suffers a loss of dignity. Thus the
æsthetic moment of the lion, he says, is when he roars
not with any definite design, but out of sheer lustiness,
and for the pure pleasure of roaring.</p>

<p>One may assume safely the æsthetic attitude, or what
amounts to the same thing, allow one’s self to be guided
by feeling, only on the assumption that feeling is worthy of
trust. As appears in the very motto he took for his “Æsthetic
Letters” Schiller was helped to this faith in man’s
native goodness by Rousseau. We need to pause for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
moment at this point and consider the background of
this belief which finds not only in Schiller but in Rousseau
himself, with whom it is usually associated, a rather
late expression. The movement that took its rise in the
eighteenth century involves, we should recollect, a break
not with one but with two traditions&mdash;the classical
and the Christian. If the plea for genius and originality
is to be largely explained as a protest against the mechanical
imitation and artificial decorum of a certain
type of classicist, the assertion of man’s natural goodness
is to be understood rather as a rebound from the doctrine
of total depravity that was held by the more austere type
of Christian. This doctrine had even in the early centuries
of the faith awakened certain protests like that of
Pelagius, but for an understanding of the Rousseauistic
protest one does not need to go behind the great deistic
movement of the early eighteenth century. God, instead
of being opposed to nature, is conceived by the deist as a
power that expresses his goodness and loveliness through
nature. The oppressive weight of fear that the older
theology had laid upon the human spirit is thus gradually
lifted. Man begins to discover harmonies instead of
discords in himself and outer nature. He not only sees
virtue in instinct but inclines to turn virtue itself into a
“sense,” or instinct. And this means in practice to put
emotional expansion in the place of spiritual concentration
at the basis of life and morals. In studying this
drift towards an æsthetic or sentimental morality one
may most conveniently take one’s point of departure
in certain English writers of deistic tendency, especially
in Shaftesbury and his disciple Hutcheson. Considered
purely as an initiator, Shaftesbury is probably more important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
than Rousseau. His influence ramifies out in
every direction, notably into Germany.</p>

<p>The central achievement of Shaftesbury from a purely
psychological point of view may be said to be his transformation
of conscience from an inner check into an
expansive emotion. He is thus enabled to set up an
æsthetic substitute not merely for traditional religion but
for traditional humanism. He undermines insidiously
decorum, the central doctrine of the classicist, at the
very time that he seems to be defending it. For decorum
also implies a control upon the expansive instincts of
human nature, and Shaftesbury is actually engaged in
rehabilitating “nature,” and insinuating that it does not
need any control. He attains this expansiveness by putting
æsthetic in the place of spiritual perception, and so
merging more or less completely the good and the true
with the beautiful. He thus points the way very directly
to Rousseau’s rejection of both inner and outer control in
the name of man’s natural goodness. Once accept Shaftesbury’s
transformation of conscience and one is led almost
inevitably to look on everything that is expansive as
natural or vital and on everything that restricts expansion
as conventional or artificial. Villers wrote to Madame
de Staël (4 May, 1803): “The fundamental and creative
idea of all your work has been to show primitive, incorruptible,
naïve, passionate nature in conflict with the
barriers and shackles of conventional life. … Note that
this is also the guiding idea of the author of ‘Werther.’”
This contrast between nature and convention is indeed
almost the whole of Rousseauism. In permitting his expansive
impulses to be disciplined by either humanism or
religion man has fallen away from nature much as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
old theology he has fallen away from God, and the famous
“return to nature” means in practice the emancipation
of the ordinary or temperamental self that had
been thus artificially controlled. This throwing off of the
yoke of both Christian and classical discipline in the
name of temperament is the essential aspect of the movement
in favor of original genius. The genius does not
look to any pattern that is set above his ordinary spontaneous
ego and imitate it. On the contrary, he attains
to the self-expression that other men, intimidated by
convention, weakly forego.</p>

<p>In thus taking a stand for self-expression, the original
genius is in a sense on firm ground&mdash;at least so far as
the mere rationalist or the late and degenerate classicist
is concerned. No conventions are final, no rules can set
arbitrary limits to creation. Reality cannot be locked up
in any set of formulæ. The element of change and novelty
in things, as the romanticists are never tired of
repeating, is at once vital and inexhaustible. Wherever
we turn, we encounter, as a romantic authority, Jacob
Boehme, declares, “abysmal, unsearchable and infinite
multiplicity.” Perhaps not since the beginning of the
world have two men or indeed two leaves or two blades
of grass been exactly alike. Out of a thousand men shaving,
as Dr. Johnson himself remarked, no two will shave
in just the same way. A person carries his uniqueness
even into his thumbprint&mdash;as a certain class in the community
has learned to its cost. But though all things are
ineffably different they are at the same time ineffably
alike. And this oneness in things is, no less than the otherwiseness,
a matter of immediate perception. This universal
implication of the one in the many is found even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
more marked than elsewhere in the heart of the individual.
Each man has his idiosyncrasy (literally his “private
mixture”). But in addition to his complexion, his temperamental
or private self, every man has a self that he
possesses in common with other men. Even the man who
is most filled with his own uniqueness, or “genius,” a
Rousseau, for example, assumes this universal self in
every word he utters. “Jove nods to Jove behind us as we
talk.” The word character, one may note, is ambiguous,
inasmuch as it may refer either to the idiosyncratic or
to the universal human element in a man’s dual nature.
For example, an original genius like William Blake not
only uses the word character in a different sense from
Aristotle&mdash;he cannot even understand the Aristotelian
usage. “Aristotle,” he complains, “says characters are
either good or bad; now Goodness or Badness has nothing
to do with Character. An apple tree, a pear tree, a
horse, a lion are Characters; but a good apple tree or a
bad is an apple tree still, etc.” But character as Aristotle
uses the word implies something that man possesses and
that a horse or tree does not possess&mdash;the power namely
to deliberate and choose. A man has a good or bad character,
he is ethical or unethical, as one may say from the
Greek word for character in this sense (ἦθος), according
to the quality of his choice as it appears in what he
actually does. This distinction between a man’s private,
peculiar character (χαρακτήρ) and the character he possesses
when judged with reference to something more
general than his own complexion is very similar to the
French distinction between the <i>sens propre</i> and the <i>sens
commun</i>.</p>

<p>The general sense or norm that is opposed to mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
temperament and impulse may rest upon the ethos of
a particular time and country&mdash;the traditional habits
and customs that the Rousseauist is wont to dismiss as
“artificial”&mdash;or it may rest in varying degrees upon
immediate perception. For example, the Ismene and
Antigone of Sophocles are both ethical; but Ismene would
abide by the law of the state, whereas Antigone opposes
to this law something still more universal&mdash;the “unwritten
laws of heaven.” This insight of Antigone into a
moral order that is set not only above her ordinary self
but above the convention of her time and country is
something very immediate, something achieved, as I shall
try to show more fully later, with the aid of the imagination.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add that such a perfect
example of the ethical imagination as one finds in Antigone&mdash;the
imagination that works concentric with the
human law&mdash;is rare. In actual life for one Antigone
who obeys the “unwritten laws of heaven” there will be
a thousand Ismenes who will be guided in their moral
choices by the law of the community. This law, the convention
of a particular place and time, is always but a very
imperfect image, a mere shadow indeed of the unwritten
law which being above the ordinary rational level is, in a
sense to be explained later, infinite and incapable of final
formulation. And yet men are forced if only on practical
grounds to work out some approximation to this law as a
barrier to the unchained appetites of the individual. The
elements that enter into any particular attempt to circumscribe
the individual in the interests of the community
are very mixed and in no small measure relative.
Yet the things that any group of men have come together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
about&mdash;their conventions in the literal meaning of the
word&mdash;even the tabus of a savage tribe, are sure to
reflect, however inadequately, the element of oneness in
man, the element which is opposed to expansive impulse,
and which is no less real, no less a matter of immediate
experience, than the element of irreducible difference.
The general sense therefore should never be sacrificed
lightly to the sense of the individual. Tabu, however
inferior it may be to insight, deserves to rank higher
after all than mere temperament.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The original genius proceeds upon the opposite assumption.
Everything that limits temperamental expansion is
dismissed as either artificial or mechanical; everything
on the contrary that makes for the emancipation of
temperament, and so for variety and difference, he welcomes
as vital, dynamic, creative. Now, speaking not
metaphysically but practically and experimentally, man
may, as I have said, follow two main paths: he may develop
his ethical self&mdash;the self that lays hold of unity&mdash;or
he may put his main emphasis on the element within
him and without him that is associated with novelty and
change. In direct proportion as he turns his attention to
the infinite manifoldness of things he experiences wonder;
if on the other hand he attends to the unity that underlies
the manifoldness and that likewise transcends him,
he experiences awe. As a man grows religious, awe comes
more and more to take the place in him of wonder. The
humanist is less averse from the natural order and its
perpetual gushing forth of novelties than the man who is
religious, yet even the humanist refuses to put his final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
emphasis on wonder (his motto is rather <i>nil admirari</i>).
To illustrate concretely, Dr. Johnson can scarcely conceal
his disdain for the wonderful, but being a genuinely
religious spirit, is very capable of awe. Commenting
on Yalden’s line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Awhile th’ Almighty wondering stood,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Johnson remarks: “He ought to have remembered
that Infinite Knowledge can never wonder. All wonder is
the effect of novelty upon Ignorance.” Granted the justness
of the remark, Johnson seems inclined at times to
forget how wide is the gap in this respect between us and
the Almighty and therefore to be unduly hostile to the
element of wonder. To take the opposite case, it is not
easy to discover in either the personality or writings of
Poe an atom of awe or reverence. On the other hand he
both experiences wonder and seeks in his art to be a pure
wondersmith. It is especially important to determine a
man’s attitude towards himself in this matter of awe and
wonder, in other words to determine whether he is taken
up first of all with that element in his own nature which
makes him incomprehensibly like other men or with that
element which makes him incomprehensibly different
from them. A man, the wise have always insisted, should
look with reverence but not with wonder on himself.
Rousseau boasts that if not better than other men, he is
at least different. By this gloating sense of his own otherwiseness
he may be said to have set the tone for a whole
epoch. Chateaubriand, for instance, is quite overcome by
his own uniqueness and wonderfulness. At the most ordinary
happenings he exclaims, as Sainte-Beuve points out,
that such things happen only to him. Hugo again is positively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
stupefied at the immensity of his own genius.
The theatricality that one feels in so much of the art of
this period arises from the eagerness of the genius to
communicate to others something of the amazement
that he feels at himself. René’s first concern is to inspire
wonder even in the women who love him. “Céluta felt
that she was going to fall upon the bosom of this man as
one falls into an abyss.”</p>

<p>In thus putting such an exclusive emphasis on wonder
the Rousseauistic movement takes on a regressive character.
For if life begins in wonder it culminates in awe.
To put “the budding rose above the rose full-blown” may
do very well for a mood, but as an habitual attitude it
implies that one is more interested in origins than in ends;
and this means in practice to look backward and downward
instead of forward and up. The conscious analysis
that is needed if one is to establish orderly sequences
and relationships and so work out a kingdom of ends
is repudiated by the Rousseauist because it diminishes
wonder, because it interferes with the creative impulse of
genius as it gushes up spontaneously from the depths of
the unconscious. The whole movement is filled with the
praise of ignorance and of those who still enjoy its inappreciable
advantages&mdash;the savage, the peasant and above
all the child. The Rousseauist may indeed be said to have
discovered the poetry of childhood of which only traces
can be found in the past, but at what would seem at times
a rather heavy sacrifice of rationality. Rather than consent
to have the bloom taken off things by analysis one
should, as Coleridge tells us, <i>sink back</i> to the devout state
of childlike wonder. However, to grow ethically is not
to sink back but to struggle painfully forward. To affirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the contrary is to set up the things that are below the
ordinary rational level as a substitute for the things that
are above it, and at the same time to proclaim one’s
inability to mature. The romanticist, it is true, is wont to
oppose to the demand for maturity Christ’s praise of the
child. But Christ evidently praises the child not because
of his capacity for wonder but because of his freedom
from sin, and it is of the essence of Rousseauism to deny
the very existence of sin&mdash;at least in the Christian
sense of the word. One may also read in the New Testament
that when one has ceased to be a child one should
give up childish things, and this is a saying that no primitivist,
so far as I am aware, has ever quoted. On the
contrary, he is ready to assert that what comes to the
child spontaneously is superior to the deliberate moral
effort of the mature man. The speeches of all the sages
are, according to Maeterlinck, outweighed by the unconscious
wisdom of the passing child. Wordsworth hails
a child of six as “Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!” (It is
only fair to Coleridge to say that he refused to follow
Wordsworth into this final abyss of absurdity.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>) In
much the same way Hugo pushes his adoration of the
child to the verge of what has been termed “solemn silliness”
(<i>niaiserie solennelle</i>).</p>

<p>To set up the spontaneity of the child as a substitute
for insight, to identify wonder with awe, romance with
religion, is to confuse the very planes of being. There
would appear to be a confusion of this kind in what
Carlyle takes to be his own chief discovery, in his “natural
supernaturalism.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The natural order we must grant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Carlyle is unfathomable, but it is not therefore awful,
only wonderful. A movement of charity belongs as Pascal
says to an entirely different order.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The spiritual order to which Pascal refers lifts a man
so far as he perceives it out of his ordinary self and draws
him to an ethical centre. But the Rousseauist tends, as
I have said, to repudiate the very idea of an ethical centre
along with the special forms in which it had got itself
embedded. Every attempt, whether humanistic or religious,
to set up some such centre, to oppose a unifying
and centralizing principle to expansive impulse, seems to
him arbitrary and artificial. He does not discriminate
between the ethical norm or centre that a Sophocles
grasps intuitively and the centrality that the pseudo-classicist
hopes to achieve by mechanical imitation. He
argues from his underlying assumption that the principle
of variation is alone vital, that one’s genius and
originality are in pretty direct ratio to one’s eccentricity
in the literal meaning of the word; and he is therefore
ready to affirm his singularity or difference in the face of
whatever happens to be established. This attitude, it is
worth noting, is quite unlike that of the humorist in the
old English sense of the word, who indulges his bent and
is at the same time quite unconcerned with any central
model that he should imitate and with reference to which
he should discipline his oddities. The idiosyncrasy of
the Rousseauist is not, like that of the humorist, genial,
but defiant. He is strangely self-conscious in his return
to the unconscious. In everything, from his vocabulary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to the details of his dress, he is eager to emphasize his
departure from the norm. Hence the persistent pose and
theatricality in so many of the leaders of this movement,
in Rousseau himself, for instance, or in Chateaubriand
and Byron. As for the lesser figures in the movement
their “genius” is often chiefly displayed in their
devices for calling attention to themselves as the latest
and most marvellous births of time; it is only one aspect
in short of an art in which the past century, whatever its
achievement in the other arts, has easily surpassed all its
predecessors&mdash;the art of advertising.</p>

<p>One needs always to return, however, if one is to understand
the romantic notion of genius, to a consideration
of the pseudo-classic decorum against which it is a protest.
The gentleman or man of the world (<i>honnête homme</i>)
was not, like the original genius, anxious to advertise
himself, to call attention to his own special note of originality,
since his primary concern was with an entirely
different problem, with the problem, namely, not of
expressing but of humanizing himself; and he could humanize
himself, he felt, only by constant reference to the
accepted standard of what the normal man should be.
He refused to “pride himself on anything”; he was fearful
of over-emphasis, because the first of virtues in his
eyes was a sense of proportion. The total symmetry of
life to which the best type of classicist refers back his
every impulse, he apprehends intuitively with the aid of
his imagination. The symmetry to which the pseudo-classicist
refers back his impulses has ceased to be
imaginative and has become a mere conformity to an
outer code or even to the rules of etiquette; and so, instead
of a deep imaginative insight, he gets mere elegance or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
polish. The unity that a purely external decorum of this
kind imposes on life degenerates into a tiresome sameness.
It seems an unwarranted denial of the element of
wonder and surprise. “Boredom was born one day of
uniformity,” said La Motte Houdard, who was himself
a pseudo-classicist; whereas variety as everybody knows
is the spice of life. The romanticist would break up the
smooth and tiresome surface of artificial decorum by the
pursuit of strangeness. If he can only get his thrill he
cares little whether it is probable, whether it bears
any relation, that is, to normal human experience. This
sacrifice of the probable to the surprising appears, as I
said at the outset, in all types of romanticism&mdash;whether
of action or thought or feeling. The genuine classicist
always puts his main stress on design or structure;
whereas the main quest of every type of romanticist is
rather for the intense and vivid and arresting detail.
Take, for instance, the intellectual romanticism that
prevailed especially in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries. In the “witty and conceited” poets of
this period the intellect is engaged in a more or less
irresponsible vagabondage with the imagination as its
free accomplice. The conceits by which a poet of this
type displays his “ingenuity” (genius) are not structural,
are not, that is, referred back to any centre. They
stand forth each separately and sharply from the surface
of the style (hence known to the French as “points”),
and so arrest the reader by their novelty. Their rareness
and preciousness, however, are intended to startle the
intellect alone. They do not have and are not intended to
have any power of sensuous suggestion. The Rousseauistic
romanticist, on the other hand, so far from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> “metaphysical,”
strives to be concrete even at the risk of a
certain materialism of style, of turning his metaphors
into mere images. Like the intellectual romanticist,
though in a different way, he wishes to break up the
smooth and monotonous surface of life and style, and
so he sets up the cult of the picturesque. To understand
this cult one needs to remember the opposite extreme of
artificial symmetry. One needs to recall, for example, the
neo-classicist who complained of the stars in heaven because
they were not arranged in symmetrical patterns,
or various other neo-classicists who attacked mountains
because of their rough and irregular shapes, because of
their refusal to submit to the rule and compass. When
beauty is conceived in so mechanical a fashion some one
is almost certain to wish to “add strangeness” to it.</p>

<p>The cult of the picturesque is closely associated with
the cult of local color. Here as elsewhere romantic genius
is, in contradistinction to classical genius which aims at
the “grandeur of generality,” the genius of wonder and
surprise. According to Buffon, who offers the rare spectacle
of a man of science who is at the same time a theorist
of the grand manner, genius is shown in the architectonic
gift&mdash;in the power so to unify a subject as to keep
its every detail in proper subordination to the whole.
Any mere wantoning of the imagination in the pursuit of
either the precious or the picturesque is to be severely
repressed if one is to attain to the grandeur of generality.
Buffon is truly classic in relating genius to design.
Unfortunately he verges towards the pseudo-classic in
his distrust of color, of the precise word and the vivid
descriptive epithet. The growing verbal squeamishness
that so strikes one towards the end of the neo-classic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
period is one outcome of artificial decorum, of confusing
nobility of language with the language of the nobility.
There was an increasing fear of the trivial word that
might destroy the illusion of the grand manner, and also
of the technical term that should be too suggestive of
specialization. All terms were to be avoided that were
not readily intelligible to a lady or gentleman in the
drawing-room. And so it came to pass that by the end of
the eighteenth century the grand manner, or elevated
style, had come to be largely an art of ingenious circumlocution,
and Buffon gives some countenance to this conception
of classic dignity and representativeness when he
declares that one should describe objects “only by the
most general terms.” At all events the reply of the romantic
genius to this doctrine is the demand for local color,
for the concrete and picturesque phrase. The general
truth at which the classicist aims the Rousseauist dismisses
as identical with the gray and the academic, and
bends all his efforts to the rendering of the vivid and
unique detail. Of the readiness of the romantic genius to
show (or one is tempted to say) to advertise his originality
by trampling verbal decorum under foot along with
every other kind of decorum, I shall have more to say
later. He is ready to employ not only the homely and
familiar word that the pseudo-classicist had eschewed as
“low,” but words so local and technical as to be unintelligible
to ordinary readers. Chateaubriand deals so
specifically with the North American Indian and his
environment that the result, according to Sainte-Beuve,
is a sort of “tattooing” of his style. Hugo bestows a
whole dictionary of architectural terms upon the reader
in his “Nôtre Dame,” and of nautical terms in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
“Toilers of the Sea.” In order to follow some of the passages
in Balzac’s “César Birotteau,” one needs to be a
lawyer or a professional accountant, and it has been said
that in order to do justice to a certain description in
Zola one would need to be a pork-butcher. In this movement
towards a highly specialized vocabulary one should
note a coöperation, as so often elsewhere, between the
two wings of the naturalistic movement&mdash;the scientific
and the emotional. The Rousseauist is, like the scientist,
a specialist&mdash;he specializes in his own sensations. He
goes in quest of emotional thrills for their own sake, just
as Napoleon’s generals, according to Sainte-Beuve, waged
war without any ulterior aim but for the sheer lust of
conquest. The vivid images and picturesque details are
therefore not sufficiently structural; each one tends to
thrust itself forward without reference to the whole and
to demand attention for its own sake.</p>

<p>The pursuit of the unrelated thrill without reference
to its motivation or probability leads in the romantic
movement to a sort of descent&mdash;often, it is true, a rapturous
and lyrical descent&mdash;from the dramatic to the
melodramatic. It is possible to trace this one-sided emphasis
on wonder not merely in vocabulary but in the
increasing resort to the principle of contrast. One suspects,
for example, that Rousseau exaggerates the grotesqueness
of his youthful failure as a musical composer
at Lausanne in order that his success in the same rôle
before the king and all the ladies of the court at Versailles
may “stick more fiery off.” The contrast that
Chateaubriand establishes between the two banks of the
Mississippi at the beginning of his “Atala” is so complete
as to put some strain on verisimilitude. One may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
note in this same description, as a somewhat different
way of sacrificing the probable to the picturesque, the
bears drunk on wild grapes and reeling on the branches
of the elms. To prove that it was possible on some particular
occasion to look down the vista of a forest glade
on the lower Mississippi and see it closed by a drunken
bear does not meet the difficulty at all. For art has to do,
as was remarked long ago, not with the possible but the
probable; and a bear in this posture is a possible but
scarcely a probable bear.</p>

<p>To return to the principle of contrast: Hugo dilates
upon his puniness as an infant (“abandoned by everybody,
even by his mother”) in order to make his later
achievement seem still more stupendous.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The use of the
antithesis as the auxiliary of surprise, the abrupt and
thrilling passage from light to shade or the contrary, finds
perhaps its culminating expression in Hugo. A study of
this one figure as it appears in his words and ideas, in his
characters and situations and subjects, would show that
he is the most melodramatic genius for whom high rank
has ever been claimed in literature. The suddenness of
Jean Valjean’s transformation from a convict into a saint
may serve as a single instance of Hugo’s readiness to
sacrifice verisimilitude to surprise in his treatment of
character.</p>

<p>Closely allied to the desire to break up the monotonous
surface of “good form” by the pointed and picturesque
style in writing is the rise of the pointed and picturesque
style in dress. A man may advertise his genius
and originality (in the romantic sense of these terms) by
departing from the accepted modes of costume as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from the accepted modes of speech. Gautier’s scarlet
waistcoat at the first performance of Hernani is of the
same order as his flamboyant epithets, his riot of local
color, and was at least as effective in achieving the
main end of his life&mdash;to be, in his own phrase, the “terror
of the sleek, baldheaded bourgeois.” In assuming
the Armenian garb to the astonishment of the rustics
of Motiers-Travers, Rousseau anticipates not merely
Gautier but innumerable other violators of conventional
correctness: here as elsewhere he deserves to rank as
the classic instance, one is tempted to say, of romantic
eccentricity. La Bruyère, an exponent of the traditional
good-breeding against which Rousseauism is a protest,
says that the gentleman allows himself to be dressed by
his tailor. He wishes to be neither ahead of the mode nor
behind it, being reluctant as he is in all things to oppose
his private sense to the general sense. His point of view
in the matter of dress is not so very remote from that of
a genuine classicism, whereas the enthusiast who recently
went about the streets of New York (until taken in by
the police) garbed as a contemporary of Pericles is no
less plainly a product of Rousseauistic revolt.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand’s relation to Rousseauism in this matter
calls for special comment. He encouraged, and to some
extent held, the belief that to show genius and originality
one must be irregular and tempestuous in all things, even
in the arrangement of one’s hair. At the same time he
preached reason. His heart, in short, was romantic, his
head classical. Both as a classicist and a romanticist
he was ready to repudiate on the one hand his master
Rousseau, and on the other his own disciples. As a romantic
genius he wished to regard himself as unique and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
so unrelated to Rousseau. At the same time he also
looked upon it as a sort of insolence for any of his own
followers to aspire to such a lonely preëminence in grief
as René. As a classicist he saw that great art aims at the
normal and the representative, and that it is therefore
absurd for people to pattern themselves on such morbid
and exceptional characters as René and Childe Harold.
Most of the romanticists indeed showed themselves very
imitative even in their attempts at uniqueness, and the
result was a second or third hand, or as one is tempted to
say, a stale eccentricity. In their mere following of the
mode many of the French romanticists of 1830 were ready
to impose a painful discipline upon themselves<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in order
to appear abnormal, in order, for instance, to acquire a
livid Byronic complexion. Some of those who wished to
seem elegiac like Lamartine rather than to emulate the
violent and histrionic revolt of the Conrads and Laras
actually succeeded, we are told, in giving themselves consumption
(hence the epithet <i>école poitrinaire</i>).</p>

<p>In outer and visible freakishness the French romanticists
of 1830 probably bore away the palm, though in
inner and spiritual remoteness from normal human
experience they can scarcely vie with the early German
romanticists. And this is doubtless due to the fact that in
France there was a more definite outer standard from
which to advertise their departure, and also to the fact
that the revolt against this standard was so largely
participated in by the painters and by writers like
Gautier who were also interested in painting. Chateaubriand
writes of the romantic painters (and the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
will also serve to illustrate his attitude towards his own
disciples): “[These artists] rig themselves up as comic
sketches, as grotesques, as caricatures. Some of them
wear frightful mustaches, one would suppose that they
are going forth to conquer the world&mdash;their brushes are
halberds, their paint-scratchers sabres; others have
enormous beards and hair that puffs out or hangs down
their shoulders; they smoke a cigar volcanically. These
cousins of the rainbow, to use a phrase of our old Régnier,
have their heads filled with deluges, seas, rivers,
forests, cataracts, tempests, or it may be with slaughters,
tortures and scaffolds. One finds among them human
skulls, foils, mandolins, helmets and dolmans. … They
aim to form a separate species between the ape and
the satyr; they give you to understand that the secrecy
of the studio has its dangers and that there is no safety
for the models.”</p>

<p>These purely personal eccentricities that so marked
the early stages in the warfare between the Bohemian
and the philistine have as a matter of fact diminished in
our own time. Nowadays a man of the distinction of
Disraeli or even of Bulwer-Lytton<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> would scarcely affect,
as they did, the flamboyant style in dress. But the underlying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
failure to discriminate between the odd and the
original has persisted and has worked out into even
extremer consequences. One may note, as I have said,
even in the early figures in the movement a tendency
to play to the gallery, a something that suggests the
approach of the era of the lime-light and the big headline.
Rousseau himself has been called the father of
yellow journalists. There is an unbroken development
from the early exponents of original genius down to
cubists, futurists and post-impressionists and the corresponding
schools in literature. The partisans of expression
as opposed to form in the eighteenth century led to the
fanatics of expression in the nineteenth and these have
led to the maniacs of expression of the twentieth. The
extremists in painting have got so far beyond Cézanne,
who was regarded not long ago as one of the wildest of
innovators, that Cézanne is, we are told, “in a fair way
to achieve the unhappy fate of becoming a classic.” Poe
was fond of quoting a saying of Bacon’s that “there is
no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in
the proportion.” This saying became known in France
through Baudelaire’s rendering of Poe and was often
ascribed to Poe himself. It was taken to mean that the
stranger one became the nearer one was getting to perfect
beauty. And if we grant this view of beauty we must
admit that some of the decadents succeeded in becoming
very beautiful indeed. But the more the element of proportion
in beauty is sacrificed to strangeness the more
the result will seem to the normal man to be, not beauty
at all, but rather an esoteric cult of ugliness. The romantic
genius therefore denounces the normal man as a
philistine and at the same time, since he cannot please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
him, seeks at least to shock him and so capture his
attention by the very violence of eccentricity.</p>

<p>The saying I have quoted from Bacon is perhaps an
early example of the inner alliance between things that
superficially often seem remote&mdash;the scientific spirit
and the spirit of romance. Scientific discovery has given
a tremendous stimulus to wonder and curiosity, has encouraged
a purely exploratory attitude towards life and
raised an overwhelming prepossession in favor of the
new as compared with the old. Baconian and Rousseauist
evidently come together by their primary emphasis
on novelty. The movement towards a more and more
eccentric conception of art and literature has been closely
allied in practice with the doctrine of progress&mdash;and
that from the very dawn of the so-called Quarrel of
Ancients and Moderns. It is scarcely possible to exaggerate
the havoc that has been wrought by the transfer of
the belief that the latest thing is the best&mdash;a belief that
is approximately true of automobiles&mdash;from the material
order to an entirely different realm.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The very heart of
the classical message, one cannot repeat too often, is that
one should aim first of all not to be original, but to be
human, and that to be human one needs to look up to a
sound model and imitate it. The imposition of form and
proportion upon one’s expansive impulses which results
from this process of imitation is, in the true sense of that
much abused word, culture. Genuine culture is difficult
and disciplinary. The mediation that it involves between
the conflicting claims of form and expression requires
the utmost contention of spirit. We have here a clue to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the boundless success of the Rousseauistic doctrine of
spontaneity, of the assertion that genius resides in the
region of the primitive and unconscious and is hindered
rather than helped by culture. It is easier to be a genius
on Rousseauistic lines than to be a man on the terms
imposed by the classicist. There is a fatal facility about
creation when its quality is not tested by some standard
set above the creator’s temperament; and the same
fatal facility appears in criticism when the critic does
not test creation by some standard set above both his
own temperament and that of the creator. The romantic
critic as a matter of fact confines his ambition to receiving
so keen an impression from genius, conceived as something
purely temperamental, that when this creative
expression is passed through his temperament it will issue
forth as a fresh expression. Taste, he holds, will thus
tend to become one with genius, and criticism, instead
of being cold and negative like that of the neo-classicist,
will itself grow creative.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> But the critic who does not
get beyond this stage will have gusto, zest, relish, what
you will, he will not have taste. For taste involves a
difficult mediation between the element of uniqueness in
both critic and creator and that which is representative
and human. Once eliminate this human standard
that is set above the temperament of the creator and
make of the critic in turn a mere pander to “genius”
and it is hard to see what measure of a man’s excellence
is left save his intoxication with himself; and this measure
would scarcely seem to be trustworthy. “Every ass
that’s romantic,” says Wolseley in his Preface to “Valentinian”
(1686)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> “believes he’s inspired.”</p>

<p>An important aspect of the romantic theory of genius
remains to be considered. This theory is closely associated
in its rise and growth with the theory of the master
faculty or ruling passion. A man can do that for which
he has a genius without effort, whereas no amount of
effort can avail to give a man that for which he has no
native aptitude.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Buffon affirmed in opposition to this
view that genius is only a capacity for taking pains or, as
an American recently put it, is ten per cent inspiration
and ninety per cent perspiration. This notion of genius
not only risks running counter to the observed facts as
to the importance of the native gift but it does not bring
out as clearly as it might the real point at issue. Even
though genius were shown to be ninety per cent inspiration
a man should still, the classicist would insist, fix his
attention on the fraction that is within his power. Thus
Boileau says in substance at the outset of his “Art of
Poetry” that a poet needs to be born under a propitious
star. Genius is indispensable, and not merely genius in
general but genius for the special kind of poetry in which
he is to excel. Yet granting all this, he says to the poetical
aspirant, bestir yourself! The mystery of grace will
always be recognized in any view of life that gets at all
beneath the surface. Yet it is still the better part to turn
to the feasibility of works. The view of genius as merely
a temperamental overflow is as a matter of fact only a
caricature of the doctrine of grace. It suits the spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
indolence of the creator who seeks to evade the more
difficult half of his problem&mdash;which is not merely to
create but to humanize his creation. Hawthorne, for
example, is according to Mr. Brownell, too prone (except
in the “Scarlet Letter”) to get away from the clear sunlight
of normal human experience into a region of somewhat
crepuscular symbolism, and this is because he
yielded too complacently and fatalistically to what he
conceived to be his genius. The theory of genius is perhaps
the chief inheritance of the New England transcendentalists
from romanticism. Hawthorne was more
on his guard against the extreme implications of the
theory than most other members of this group. It remains
to be seen how much the exaltation of genius and depreciation
of culture that marks one whole side of Emerson
will in the long run tell against his reputation. The lesser
New England men showed a rare incapacity to distinguish
between originality and mere freakishness either
in themselves or in others.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that in lieu of the discipline of culture
the romantic genius has often insisted on the discipline of
technique; and this has been especially true in a country
like France with its persistent tradition of careful workmanship.
Gautier, for example, would have one’s “floating
dream sealed”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> in the hardest and most resisting
material, that can only be mastered by the perfect craftsman;
and he himself, falling into a confusion of the arts,
tries to display such a craftsmanship by painting and
carving with words. Flaubert, again, refines upon the
technique of writing to a point where it becomes not
merely a discipline but a torture. But if a man is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a romantic genius in the fullest sense he must, it should
seem, repudiate even the discipline of technique as well
as the discipline of culture in favor of an artless spontaneity.
For after all the genius is only the man who
retains the virtues of the child, and technical proficiency
is scarcely to be numbered among these virtues. The
German romanticists already prefer the early Italian
painters because of their naïveté and divine awkwardness
to the later artiste who had a more conscious mastery
of their material. The whole Pre-Raphaelite movement
is therefore only one aspect of Rousseau’s return to nature.
To later primitivists the early Italians themselves
seem far too deliberate. They would recover the spontaneity
displayed in the markings on Alaskan totem
poles or in the scratchings of the caveman on the flint.
A prerequisite to pure genius, if we are to judge by
their own productions, is an inability to draw. The futurists
in their endeavor to convey symbolically their
own “soul” or “vision”&mdash;a vision be it noted of pure
flux and motion&mdash;deny the very conditions of time and
space that determine the special technique of painting;
and inasmuch as to express one’s “soul” means for these
moderns, as it did for the “genius” of the eighteenth
century, to express the ineffable difference between
themselves and others, the symbolizing of this soul to
which they have sacrificed both culture and technique
remains a dark mystery.</p>

<p>An eccentricity so extreme as to be almost or quite
indistinguishable from madness is then the final outcome
of the revolt of the original genius from the regularity of
the eighteenth century. The eighteenth century had,
one must confess, become too much like the Happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Valley from which Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia, sought
an egress. It was fair to the eye and satisfied all man’s
ordinary needs, but it seemed at the same time to hem
him in oppressively, and limit unduly his horizons.
For the modern man, as for the prince in Johnson’s
tale, a regular round of assured felicities has counted for
nought as compared with the passion for the open; though
now that he has tasted strange adventures, the modern
man will scarcely decide at the end, like the prince,
to “return to Abyssinia.” I have already spoken of the
rationalistic and pseudo-classic elements in the eighteenth
century that the romantic rebels found so intolerable.
It is impossible to follow “reason,” they said in substance,
and also to slake one’s thirst for the “infinite”;
it is impossible to conform and imitate and at the same
time to be free and original and spontaneous. Above all
it is impossible to submit to the yoke of either reason
or imitation and at the same time to be imaginative. This
last assertion will always be the main point at issue in
any genuine debate between classicist and romanticist.
The supreme thing in life, the romanticist declares, is
the creative imagination, and it can be restored to its
rights only by repudiating imitation. The imagination is
supreme the classicist grants but adds that to imitate
rightly is to make the highest use of the imagination.
To understand all that is implied in this central divergence
between classicist and romanticist we shall need
to study in more detail the kind of imaginative activity
that has been encouraged in the whole movement extending
from the rise of the original genius in the eighteenth
century to the present day.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">ROMANTIC IMAGINATION</span></h2>

<p>I have already spoken of the contrast established by the
theorists of original genius in the eighteenth century
between the different types of imagination&mdash;especially
between the literary and the scientific imagination. According
to these theorists, it will be remembered, the
scientific imagination should be strictly subordinated to
judgment, whereas the literary imagination, freed from
the shackles of imitation, should be at liberty to wander
wild in its own empire of chimeras, or, at all events,
should be far less sharply checked by judgment. It is
easy to follow the extension of these English views of
genius and imagination into the France of Rousseau and
Diderot, and then the elaboration of these same views,
under the combined influence of both France and England,
in Germany. I have tried to show that Kant,
especially in his “Critique of Judgment,” and Schiller
in his “Æsthetic Letters” (1795) prepare the way for
the conception of the creative imagination that is at the
very heart of the romantic movement. According to this
romantic conception, as we have seen, the imagination is
to be free, not merely from outer formalistic constraint,
but from all constraint whatever. This extreme romantic
emancipation of the imagination was accompanied by an
equally extreme emancipation of the emotions. Both kinds
of emancipation are, as I have tried to show, a recoil
partly from neo-classical judgment&mdash;a type of judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which seemed to oppress all that is creative and spontaneous
in man under a weight of outer convention;
partly, from the reason of the Enlightenment, a type
of reason that was so logical and abstract that it seemed
to mechanize the human spirit, and to be a denial of all
that is immediate and intuitive. The neo-classical judgment,
with its undue unfriendliness to the imagination,
is itself a recoil, let us remember, from the imaginative
extravagance of the “metaphysicals,” the intellectual romanticists
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and also, if we take a sufficiently wide view, from the
Quixotic type of romanticism, the romanticism of action,
that we associate with the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Now not only are men governed by their imaginations
(the imagination, as Pascal says, disposes of everything),
but the type of imagination by which most men are
governed may be defined in the widest sense of the word
as romantic. Nearly every man cherishes his dream, his
conceit of himself as he would like to be, a sort of “ideal”
projection of his own desires, in comparison with which
his actual life seems a hard and cramping routine.
“Man must conceive himself what he is not,” as Dr.
Johnson says, “for who is pleased with what he is?”
The ample habitation that a man rears for his fictitious
or “ideal” self often has some slight foundation in fact,
but the higher he rears it the more insecure it becomes,
until finally, like Perrette in the fable, he brings the whole
structure down about his ears by the very gesture of his
dream. “We all of us,” La Fontaine concludes in perhaps
the most delightful account of the romantic imagination
in literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> “wise as well as foolish, indulge in daydreams.
There is nothing sweeter. A flattering illusion
carries away our spirits. All the wealth in the world is
ours, all honors and all women,”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> etc. When Johnson
descants on the “dangerous prevalence of imagination,”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and warns us to stick to “sober probability,” what he
means is the dangerous prevalence of day-dreaming.
The retreat of the Rousseauist into some “land of chimeras”
or tower of ivory assumes forms almost incredibly
complex and subtle, but at bottom the ivory tower is only
one form of man’s ineradicable longing to escape from
the oppression of the actual into some land of heart’s
desire, some golden age of fancy. As a matter of fact,
Rousseau’s imaginative activity often approaches very
closely to the delights of day-dreaming as described by
La Fontaine. He was never more imaginative, he tells us,
than when on a walking-trip&mdash;especially when the trip
had no definite goal, or at least when he could take his
time in reaching it. The <i>Wanderlust</i> of body and spirit
could then be satisfied together. Actual vagabondage
seemed to be an aid to the imagination in its escape from
verisimilitude. One should note especially Rousseau’s
account of his early wandering from Lyons to Paris and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the airy structures that he raised on his anticipations of
what he might find there. Inasmuch as he was to be
attached at Paris to the Swiss Colonel Godard, he already
traced for himself in fancy, in spite of his short-sightedness,
a career of military glory. “I had read that Marshal
Schomberg was short-sighted, why shouldn’t Marshal
Rousseau be so too?” In the meanwhile, touched by the
sight of the groves and brooks, “I felt in the midst of my
glory that my heart was not made for so much turmoil,
and soon without knowing how, I found myself once
more among my beloved pastorals, renouncing forever
the toils of Mars.”</p>

<p>Thus alongside the real world and in more or less sharp
opposition to it, Rousseau builds up a fictitious world,
that <i>pays des chimères</i>, which is alone, as he tells us,
worthy of habitation. To study his imaginative activity
is simply to study the new forms that he gives to what
I have called man’s ineradicable longing for some Arcadia,
some land of heart’s desire. Goethe compares the
illusions that man nourishes in his breast to the population
of statues in ancient Rome which were almost as
numerous as the population of living men. The important
thing from the point of view of sanity is that a man
should not blur the boundaries between the two populations,
that he should not cease to discriminate between
his fact and his fiction. If he confuses what he dreams himself
to be with what he actually is, he has already entered
upon the pathway of madness. It was, for example, natural
for a youth like Rousseau who was at once romantic
and musical, to dream that he was a great composer; but
actually to set up as a great composer and to give the
concert at Lausanne, shows an unwillingness to discriminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
between his fictitious and his real world that
is plainly pathological. If not already a megalomaniac,
he was even then on the way to megalomania.</p>

<p>To wander through the world as though it were an
Arcadia or enchanted vision contrived for one’s especial
benefit is an attitude of childhood&mdash;especially of imaginative
childhood. “Wherever children are,” says Novalis,
“there is the golden age.” As the child grows and matures
there is a more or less painful process of adjustment
between his “vision” and the particular reality in which
he is placed. A little sense gets knocked into his head,
and often, it must be confessed, a good deal of the imagination
gets knocked out. As Wordsworth complains, the
vision fades into the light of common day. The striking
fact about Rousseau is that, far more than Wordsworth,
he held fast to his vision. He refused to adjust it to an
unpalatable reality. During the very years when the
ordinary youth is forced to subordinate his luxurious
imaginings to some definite discipline he fell under the
influence of Madame de Warens who encouraged rather
than thwarted his Arcadian bent. Later, when almost
incurably confirmed in his penchant for revery, he came
into contact with the refined society of Paris, an environment
requiring so difficult an adjustment that no one we
are told could accomplish the feat unless he had been disciplined
into the appropriate habits from the age of six.
He is indeed the supreme example of the unadjusted
man, of the original genius whose imagination has never
suffered either inner or outer constraint, who is more of
an Arcadian dreamer at sixty perhaps than he was at
sixteen. He writes to the Bailli de Mirabeau (31 January,
1767):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The fatigue of thinking becomes every day more painful to me.
I love to dream, but freely, allowing my mind to wander without
enslaving myself to any subject. … This idle and contemplative
life which you do not approve and which I do not excuse, becomes to
me daily more delicious; to wander alone endlessly and ceaselessly
among the trees and rocks about my dwelling, to muse or rather to
be as irresponsible as I please, and as you say, to go wool-gathering;
… finally to give myself up unconstrainedly to my fantasies which,
thank heaven, are all within my power: that, sir, is for me the supreme
enjoyment, than which I can imagine nothing superior in this world
for a man at my age and in my condition.”</p>

</div>

<p>Rousseau, then, owes his significance not only to the
fact that he was supremely imaginative in an age that
was disposed to deny the supremacy of the imagination,
but to the fact that he was imaginative in a particular
way. A great multitude since his time must be reckoned
among his followers, not because they have held certain
ideas but because they have exhibited a similar quality
of imagination. In seeking to define this quality of imagination
we are therefore at the very heart of our subject.</p>

<p>It is clear from what has already been said that Rousseau’s
imagination was in a general way Arcadian, and
this, if not the highest, is perhaps the most prevalent
type of imagination. In surveying the literature of the
world one is struck not only by the universality of the
pastoral or idyllic element, but by the number of forms
it has assumed&mdash;forms ranging from the extreme of
artificiality and conventionalism to the purest poetry.
The very society against the artificiality of which Rousseau’s
whole work is a protest is itself in no small degree
a pastoral creation. Various elements indeed entered into
the life of the drawing-room as it came to be conceived
towards the beginning of the seventeenth century. The
Marquise de Rambouillet and others who set out at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
time to live in the grand manner were in so far governed
either by genuine or by artificial decorum. But at the same
time that the creators of <i>le grand monde</i> were aiming to
be more “decent” than the men and women of the sixteenth
century, they were patterning themselves upon the
shepherds and shepherdesses of D’Urfé’s interminable
pastoral “l’Astrée.” They were seeking to create a sort
of enchanted world from which the harsh cares of ordinary
life were banished and where they might be free,
like true Arcadians, to discourse of love. This discourse of
love was associated with what I have defined as intellectual
romanticism. In spite of the attacks by the exponents
of humanistic good sense (Molière, Boileau, etc.)
on this drawing-room affectation, it lingered on and still
led in the eighteenth century, as Rousseau complained,
to “inconceivable refinements.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> At the same time we
should recollect that there is a secret bond between all
forms of Arcadian dreaming. Not only was Rousseau
fascinated, like the early <i>précieux</i> and <i>précieuses</i>, by
D’Urfé’s pastoral, but he himself appealed by his renewal
of the main pastoral theme of love to the descendants
of these former Arcadians in the polite society of his
time. The love of Rousseau is associated not like that
of the <i>précieux</i>, with the intellect, but with the emotions,
and so he substitutes for a “wire-drawn and super-subtilized
gallantry,” the ground-swell of elemental
passion.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Moreover, the definitely primitivistic coloring
that he gave to his imaginative renewal of the pastoral
dream appealed to an age that was reaching the last stages
of over-refinement. Primitivism is, strictly speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
nothing new in the world. It always tends to appear in
periods of complex civilization. The charms of the simple
life and of a return to nature were celebrated especially
during the Alexandrian period of Greek literature for the
special delectation no doubt of the most sophisticated
members of this very sophisticated society. “Nothing,”
as Dr. Santayana says, “is farther from the common
people than the corrupt desire to be primitive.” Primitivistic
dreaming was also popular in ancient Rome at
its most artificial moment. The great ancients, however,
though enjoying the poetry of the primitivistic dream,
were not the dupes of this dream. Horace, for example,
lived at the most artificial moment of Rome when primitivistic
dreaming was popular as it had been at Alexandria.
He descants on the joys of the simple life in a well-known
ode. One should not therefore hail him, like
Schiller, as the founder of the sentimental school “of
which he has remained the unsurpassed model.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> For
the person who plans to return to nature in Horace’s
poem is the old usurer Alfius, who changes his mind at
the last moment and puts out his mortgages again. In
short, the final attitude of the urbane Horace towards
the primitivistic dream&mdash;it could hardly be otherwise&mdash;is
ironical.</p>

<p>Rousseau seems destined to remain the supreme example,
at least in the Occident, of the man who takes
the primitivistic dream seriously, who attempts to set
up primitivism as a philosophy and even as a religion.
Rousseau’s account of his sudden illumination on the
road from Paris to Vincennes is famous: the scales, he
tells us, fell from his eyes even as they had from the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of Paul on the road to Damascus, and he saw how man
had fallen from the felicity of his primitive estate; how
the blissful ignorance in which he had lived at one with
himself and harmless to his fellows had been broken by
the rise of intellectual self-consciousness and the resulting
progress in the sciences and arts. Modern students of
Rousseau have, under the influence of James, taken this
experience on the road to Vincennes to be an authentic
case of conversion,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> but this is merely one instance of
our modern tendency to confound the subrational with
the superrational. What one finds in this alleged conversion
when one looks into it, is a sort of “subliminal
uprush” of the Arcadian memories of his youth, especially
of his life at Annecy and Les Charmettes, and at
the same time the contrast between these Arcadian
memories and the hateful constraints he had suffered
at Paris in his attempts to adjust himself to an uncongenial
environment.</p>

<p>We can trace even more clearly perhaps the process
by which the Arcadian dreamer comes to set up as a seer,
in Rousseau’s relation of the circumstances under which
he came to compose his “Discourse on the Origins of
Inequality.” He goes off on a sort of picnic with Thérèse
into the forest of St. Germain and gives himself up to
imagining the state of primitive man. “Plunged in the
forest,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> “I sought and found there the image of
primitive times of which I proudly drew the history;
I swooped down on the little falsehoods of men; I ventured
to lay bare their nature, to follow the progress of
time and of circumstances which have disfigured it, and
comparing artificial man (<i>l’homme de l’homme</i>) with
natural man, to show in his alleged improvement the true
source of his miseries. My soul, exalted by these sublime
contemplations, rose into the presence of the Divinity.
Seeing from this vantage point that the blind pathway
of prejudices followed by my fellows was also that of their
errors, misfortunes and crimes, I cried out to them in a
feeble voice that they could not hear: Madmen, who are
always complaining of nature, know that all your evils
come from yourselves alone.”</p>

<p>The golden age for which the human heart has an
ineradicable longing is here presented not as poetical,
which it certainly is, but as a “state of nature” from
which man has actually fallen. The more or less innocent
Arcadian dreamer is being transformed into the dangerous
Utopist. He puts the blame of the conflict and division
of which he is conscious in himself upon the social
conventions that set bounds to his temperament and
impulses; once get rid of these purely artificial restrictions
and he feels that he will again be at one with himself
and “nature.” With such a vision of nature as this it is
not surprising that every constraint is unendurable to
Rousseau, that he likes, as Berlioz was to say of himself
later, to “make all barriers crack.” He is ready to shatter
all the forms of civilized life in favor of something that
never existed, of a state of nature that is only the projection
of his own temperament and its dominant desires
upon the void. His programme amounts in practice to
the indulgence of infinite indeterminate desire, to an endless
and aimless vagabondage of the emotions with the
imagination as their free accomplice.</p>

<p>This longing of the highly sophisticated person to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
back to the primitive and naïve and unconscious, or
what amounts to the same thing, to shake off the trammels
of tradition and reason in favor of free and passionate
self-expression, underlies, as I have pointed out, the
conception of original genius which itself underlies the
whole modern movement. A book reflecting the primitivistic
trend of the eighteenth century, and at the same time
pointing the way, as we shall see presently, to the working
out of the fundamental primitivistic contrast between the
natural and the artificial in the romanticism of the early
nineteenth century, is Schiller’s “Essay on Simple and
Sentimental Poetry.” The poetry that does not “look before
or after,” that is free from self-questioning and self-consciousness,
and has a childlike spontaneity, Schiller
calls simple or naïve. The poet, on the other hand, who is
conscious of his fall from nature and who, from the midst
of his sophistication, longs to be back once more at his
mother’s bosom, is sentimental. Homer and his heroes,
for example, are naïve; Werther, who yearns in a drawing-room
for the Homeric simplicity, is sentimental. The
longing of the modern man for nature, says Schiller,
is that of the sick man for health. It is hard to see in
Schiller’s “nature” anything more than a development
of Rousseau’s primitivistic Arcadia. To be sure, Schiller
warns us that, in order to recover the childlike and
primitive virtues still visible in the man of genius, we
must not renounce culture. We must not seek to revert
lazily to an Arcadia, but must struggle forward to an
Elysium. Unfortunately Schiller’s Elysium has a strange
likeness to Rousseau’s Arcadia; and that is because
Schiller’s own conception of life is, in the last analysis,
overwhelmingly sentimental. His most Elysian conception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that of a purely æsthetic Greece, a wonderland of
unalloyed beauty, is also a bit of Arcadian sentimentalizing.
Inasmuch as Rousseau’s state of nature never
existed outside of dreamland, the Greek who is simple
or naïve in this sense is likewise a myth. He has no real
counterpart either in the Homeric age or any other age
of Greece. It is hard to say which is more absurd, to
make the Greeks naïve, or to turn Horace into a sentimentalist.
One should note how this romantic perversion
of the Greeks for which Schiller is largely responsible
is related to his general view of the imagination. We
have seen that in the “Æsthetic Letters” he maintains
that if the imagination is to conceive the ideal it
must be free; and that to be free it must be emancipated
from purpose and engage in a sort of play. If the imagination
has to subordinate itself to a real object it ceases
in so far to be free. Hence the more ideal the imagination
the farther it gets away from a real object. By his theory
of the imagination, Schiller thus encourages that opposition
between the ideal and the real which figures so
largely in romantic psychology. A man may consent to
adjust a mere dream to the requirements of the real,
but when his dream is promoted to the dignity of an ideal
it is plain that he will be less ready to make the sacrifice.
Schiller’s Greece is very ideal in the sense I have just
defined. It hovers before the imagination as a sort of
Golden Age of pure beauty, a land of chimeras that is
alone worthy of the æsthete’s habitation. As an extreme
type of the romantic Hellenist, one may take Hölderlin,
who was a disciple at once of Schiller and of Rousseau.
He begins by urging emancipation from every form of
outer and traditional control in the name of spontaneity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“Boldly forget,” he cries in the very accents of Rousseau,
“what you have inherited and won&mdash;all laws and customs&mdash;and
like new-born babes lift up your eyes to
godlike nature.” Hölderlin has been called a “Hellenizing
Werther,” and Werther, one should recollect, is only
a German Saint-Preux, who is in turn, according to Rousseau’s
own avowal, only an idealized image of Rousseau.
The nature that Hölderlin worships and which is, like
the nature of Rousseau, only an Arcadian intoxication
of the imagination, he associates with a Greece which is,
like the Greece of Schiller, a dreamland of pure beauty.
He longs to escape into this dreamland from an actual
world that seems to him intolerably artificial. The
contrast between his “ideal” Greece and reality is so
acute as to make all attempt at adjustment out of the
question. As a result of this maladjustment his whole
being finally gave way and he lingered on for many years
in madness.</p>

<p>The acuteness of the opposition between the ideal and
the real in Hölderlin recalls Shelley, who was also a
romantic Hellenist, and at the same time perhaps the
most purely Rousseauistic of the English romantic poets.
But Shelley was also a political dreamer, and here one
should note two distinct phases in his dream: a first
phase that is filled with the hope of transforming the
real world into an Arcadia<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> through revolutionary reform;
and then a phase of elegiac disillusion when the
gap between reality and his ideal refuses to be bridged.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Something of the same radiant political hope and the
same disillusion is found in Wordsworth. In the first
flush of his revolutionary enthusiasm, France seemed
to him to be “standing on the top of golden hours” and
pointing the way to a new birth of human nature:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,</div>
<div class="verse">But to be young was very heaven! O times,</div>
<div class="verse">In which the meagre stale forbidding ways</div>
<div class="verse">Of custom, law and statute, took at once</div>
<div class="verse">The attraction of a country in romance!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When it became evident that the actual world and
Utopia did not coincide after all, when the hard sequences
of cause and effect that bind the present inexorably
to the past refused to yield to the creations of the
romantic imagination, what ensued in Wordsworth was
not so much an awakening to true wisdom as a transformation
of the pastoral dream. The English Lake Country
became for him in some measure as it was later to
be for Ruskin, the ivory tower into which he retreated
from the oppression of the real. He still continued to see,
if not the general order of society, at least the denizens
of his chosen retreat through the Arcadian mist, and
contrasted their pastoral felicity with the misery of men
“barricadoed in the walls of cities.” I do not mean to
disparage the poetry of humble life or to deny that many
passages may be cited from Wordsworth that justify his
reputation as an inspired teacher: I wish merely to point
out here and elsewhere what is specifically romantic in
the quality of his imagination.</p>

<p>After all it is to Rousseau himself even more than to
his German or English followers that one needs to turn
for the best examples of the all-pervasive conflict between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the ideal and the actual. The psychology of this
conflict is revealed with special clearness in the four letters
that he wrote to M. de Malesherbes, and into which
he has perhaps put more of himself than into any other
similar amount of his writing. His natural indolence and
impatience at the obligations and constraints of life were,
he avows to M. de Malesherbes, increased by his early
reading. At the age of eight he already knew Plutarch by
heart and had read “all novels” and shed tears over
them, he adds “by the pailful.” Hence was formed his
“heroic and romantic taste” which filled him with
aversion for everything that did not resemble his dreams.
He had hoped at first to find the equivalent of these
dreams among actual men, but after painful disillusions
he had come to look with disdain on his age and his
contemporaries. “I withdrew more and more from human
society and created for myself a society in my
imagination, a society that charmed me all the more in
that I could cultivate it without peril or effort and that
it was always at my call and such as I required it.” He
associated this dream society with the forms of outer
nature. The long walks in particular that he took during
his stay at the Hermitage were, he tells us, filled with a
“continual delirium” of this kind. “I peopled nature
with beings according to my heart. … I created for
myself a golden age to suit my fancy.” It is not unusual
for a man thus to console himself for his poverty in the
real relations of life by accumulating a huge hoard of
fairy gold. Where the Rousseauist goes beyond the ordinary
dreamer is in his proneness to regard his retirement
into some land of chimeras as a proof of his nobility
and distinction. Poetry and life he feels are irreconcilably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
opposed to each other, and he for his part is on the
side of poetry and the “ideal.” Goethe symbolized the
hopelessness of this conflict in the suicide of the young
Werther. But though Werther died, his creator continued
to live, and more perhaps than any other figure in
the whole Rousseauistic movement perceived the peril
of this conception of poetry and the ideal. He saw phantasts
all about him who refused to be reconciled to the
gap between the infinitude of their longing and the platitude
of their actual lot. Perhaps no country and time
ever produced more such phantasts than Germany of
the Storm and Stress and romantic periods&mdash;partly no
doubt because it did not offer any proper outlet for the
activity of generous youths. Goethe himself had been a
phantast, and so it was natural in works like his “Tasso”
that he should show himself specially preoccupied with
the problem of the poet and his adjustment to life. About
the time that he wrote this play, he was, as he tells us,
very much taken up with thoughts of “Rousseau and his
hypochondriac misery.” Rousseau for his part felt a
kinship between himself and Tasso, and Goethe’s Tasso
certainly reminds us very strongly of Rousseau. Carried
away by his Arcadian imaginings, Tasso violates the decorum
that separates him from the princess with whom
he has fallen in love. As a result of the rebuffs that follow,
his dream changes into a nightmare, until he
finally falls like Rousseau into wild and random suspicion
and looks on himself as the victim of a conspiracy.
In opposition to Tasso is the figure of Antonio, the man
of the world, whose imagination does not run away with
his sense of fact, and who is therefore equal to the “demands
of the day.” The final reconciliation between Tasso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and Antonio, if not very convincing dramatically, symbolizes
at least what Goethe achieved in some measure
in his own life. There were moments, he declares, when
he might properly look upon himself as mad, like Rousseau.
He escaped from this world of morbid brooding,
this giddy downward gazing into the bottomless pit of
the romantic heart against which he utters a warning
in Tasso, by his activity at the court of Weimar, by
classical culture, by scientific research. Goethe carries
the same problem of reconciling the ideal to the real a
stage further in his “Wilhelm Meister.” The more or less
irresponsible and Bohemian youth that we see at the
beginning learns by renunciation and self-limitation to
fit into a life of wholesome activity. Goethe saw that the
remedy for romantic dreaming is work, though he is
open to grave criticism, as I shall try to show elsewhere,
for his unduly naturalistic conception of work. But the
romanticists as a rule did not wish work in any sense
and so, attracted as they were by the free artistic life
of Meister at the beginning, they looked upon his final
adjustment to the real as a base capitulation to philistinism.
Novalis described the book as a “Candide directed
against poetry,” and set out to write a counterblast in
“Heinrich von Ofterdingen.” This apotheosis of pure
poetry, as he meant it to be, is above all an apotheosis of
the wildest vagabondage of the imagination. Novalis
did not, however, as a result of the conflict between the
ideal and the real, show any signs of going mad like
Hölderlin, or of simply fading from life like his friend
Wackenroder. Like E. T. A. Hoffmann and a certain
number of other phantasts he had a distinct gift for
leading a dual life&mdash;for dividing himself into a prosaic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
self which went one way, and a poetical self which went
another.</p>

<p>This necessary and fatal opposition between poetry
and prose the romanticist saw typified in “Don Quixote,”
and of course he sided with the idealism of the knight
against the philistine good sense of Sancho Panza; and so
for the early romanticists as well as for those who were
of their spiritual posterity,&mdash;Heine, for example, and
Flaubert,&mdash;“Don Quixote” was a book to evoke not
laughter but tears.</p>

<p>To the romantic conception of the ideal can be traced
the increasing lack of understanding between the poet,
or in general the creator, and the public during the past
century. Many neo-classical writers may, like Boileau,
have shown an undue reverence for what they conceived
to be the general sense of their time, but to measure one’s
inspiration by one’s remoteness from this general sense
is surely a far more dangerous error; and yet one was
encouraged to do this very thing by the views of original
genius that were held in the eighteenth century. Certain
late neo-classicists lacked imagination and were at the
same time always harping on good sense. It was therefore
assumed that to insist on good sense was necessarily
proof of a lack of imagination. Because the attempt to
achieve the universal had led to a stale and lifeless imitation
it was assumed that a man’s genius consists in his
uniqueness, in his unlikeness to other men. Now nothing
is more private and distinctive in a man than his feelings,
so that to be unique meant practically for Rousseau and
his followers to be unique in feeling. Feeling alone they
held was vital and immediate. As a matter of fact the
element in a man’s nature that he possesses in common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
with other men is also something that he <i>senses</i>, something
that is in short intuitive and immediate. But good
sense the genius identifies with lifeless convention and so
measures his originality by the distance of his emotional
and imaginative recoil from it. Of this warfare between
sense and sensibility that begins in the eighteenth century,
the romantic war between the poet and the philistine
is only the continuation. This war has been bad for
both artist and public. If the artist has become more and
more eccentric, it must be confessed that the good sense
of the public against which he has protested has been
too flatly utilitarian. The poet who reduces poetry to
the imaginative quest of strange emotional adventure,
and the plain citizen who does not aspire beyond a reality
that is too literal and prosaic, both suffer; but the æsthete
suffers the more severely&mdash;so much so that I shall need
to revert to this conception of poetry in my treatment
of romantic melancholy. It leads at last to a contrast
between the ideal and the real such as is described by
Anatole France in his account of Villiers de l’Isle Adam.
“For thirty years,” says M. France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> “Villiers wandered
around in cafés at night, fading away like a shadow at
the first glimmer of dawn. … His poverty, the frightful
poverty of cities, had so put its stamp on him and fashioned
him so thoroughly that he resembled those vagabonds,
who, dressed in black, sleep on park benches. He
had the livid complexion with red blotches, the glassy
eye, the bowed back of the poor; and yet I am not sure
we should call him unhappy, for he lived in a perpetual
dream and that dream was radiantly golden. … His dull
eyes contemplated within himself dazzling spectacles.
He passed through the world like a somnambulist seeing
nothing of what we see and seeing things that it is not
given us to behold. Out of the commonplace spectacle of
life he succeeded in creating an ever fresh ecstasy. On
those ignoble café tables in the midst of the odor of beer
and tobacco, he poured forth floods of purple and gold.”</p>

<p>This notion that literal failure is ideal success, and
conversely, has been developed in a somewhat different
form by Rostand in his “Cyrano de Bergerac.” By his
refusal to compromise or adjust himself to things as
they are, Cyrano’s real life has become a series of defeats.
He is finally forced from life by a league of all the mediocrities
whom his idealism affronts. His discomfiture is
taken to show, not that he is a Quixotic extremist, but
that he is the superior of the successful Guise, the man
who has stooped to compromise, the French equivalent of
the Antonio whom Goethe finally came to prefer to Tasso.
Rostand’s “Chanticleer” is also an interesting study
of romantic idealism and of the two main stages through
which it passes&mdash;the first stage when one relates one’s
ideal to the real; the second, when one discovers that the
ideal and the real are more or less hopelessly dissevered.
Chanticleer still maintains his idealistic pose even after he
has discovered that the sun is not actually made to rise
by his crowing. In this hugging of his illusion in defiance
of reality Chanticleer is at the opposite pole from
Johnson’s astronomer in “Rasselas” who thinks that
he has control of the weather, but when disillusioned is
humbly thankful at having escaped from this “dangerous
prevalence of imagination,” and entered once more
into the domain of “sober probability.”</p>

<p>The problem, then, of the genius or the artist versus
the philistine has persisted without essential modification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
from the eighteenth century to the present day&mdash;from
the suicide of Chatterton, let us say, to the suicide
of John Davidson. The man of imagination spurns in the
name of his “ideal” the limits imposed upon it by a dull
respectability, and then his ideal turns out only too often
to lack positive content and to amount in practice to
the expansion of infinite indeterminate desire. What the
idealist opposes to the real is not only something that
does not exist, but something that never can exist. The
Arcadian revery which should be allowed at most as
an occasional solace from the serious business of living
is set up as a substitute for living. The imaginative
and emotional dalliance of the Rousseauistic romanticist
may assume a bewildering variety of forms. We have
already seen in the case of Hölderlin how easily Rousseau’s
dream of a state of nature passes over&mdash;and that
in spite of Rousseau’s attacks on the arts&mdash;into the
dream of a paradise of pure beauty. The momentous
matter is not that a man’s imagination and emotions go
out towards this or that particular haven of refuge in the
future or in the past, in the East or in the West, but that
his primary demand on life is for some haven of refuge;
that he longs to be away from the here and now and their
positive demands on his character and will. Poe may
sing of “the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that
was Rome,” but he is not therefore a classicist. With the
same wistfulness innumerable romanticists have looked towards
the Middle Ages. So C. E. Norton says that Ruskin
was a white-winged anachronism,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> that he should have
been born in the thirteenth century. But one may surmise
that a man with Ruskin’s special quality of imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
would have failed to adjust himself to the actual life of
the thirteenth or any other century. Those who put their
Arcadia in the Middle Ages or some other period of the
past have at least this advantage over those who put it
in the present, they are better protected against disillusion.
The man whose Arcadia is distant from him merely
in space may decide to go and see for himself, and the
results of this overtaking of one’s dream are somewhat
uncertain. The Austrian poet Lenau, for example, actually
took a trip to his primitive paradise that he had
imagined somewhere in the neighborhood of Pittsburgh.
Perhaps it is not surprising that he finally died mad.
The disenchantment of Chateaubriand in his quest for
a Rousseauistic Arcadia in America and for Arcadian
savages I describe later. In his journey into the wilderness
Chateaubriand reveals himself as a spiritual lotos-eater
no less surely than the man who takes flight into
what is superficially most remote from the virgin forest&mdash;into
some palace of art. His attitude towards
America does not differ psychically from that of many
early romanticists towards Italy. Italy was their land
of heart’s desire, the land that filled them with ineffable
longing (<i>Sehnsucht nach Italien</i>), a palace of art that, like
the Latin Quarter of later Bohemians, had some points
of contact with Mohammed’s paradise. A man may even
develop a romantic longing for the very period against
which romanticism was originally a protest and be
ready to “fling his cap for polish and for Pope.” One
should add that the romantic Eldorado is not necessarily
rural. Lamb’s attitude towards London is almost as
romantic as that of Wordsworth towards the country.
Dr. Johnson cherished urban life because of its centrality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Lamb’s imaginative dalliance, on the other hand, is stimulated
by the sheer variety and wonder of the London
streets as another’s might be by the mountains or the
sea.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Lamb could also find an Elysium of unmixed æsthetic
solace in the literature of the past&mdash;especially in
Restoration Comedy.</p>

<p>The essence of the mood is always the straining of the
imagination away from the here and now, from an
actuality that seems paltry and faded compared to the
radiant hues of one’s dream. The classicist, according to
A. W. Schlegel,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> is for making the most of the present,
whereas the romanticist hovers between recollection
and hope. In Shelleyan phrase he “looks before and after
and pines for what is not.” He inclines like the Byronic
dandy, Barbey d’Aurevilly, to take for his mottoes the
words “Too late” and “Nevermore.”</p>

<p>Nostalgia, the term that has come to be applied to the
infinite indeterminate longing of the romanticist&mdash;his
never-ending quest after the ever-fleeting object of desire&mdash;is
not, from the point of view of strict etymology, well-chosen.
Romantic nostalgia is not “homesickness,” accurately
speaking, but desire to get away from home.
Odysseus in Homer suffers from true nostalgia. The
Ulysses of Tennyson, on the other hand, is nostalgic
in the romantic sense when he leaves home “to sail
beyond the sunset.” Ovid, as Goethe points out, is
highly classical even in his melancholy. The longing
from which he suffers in his exile is very determinate:
he longs to get back to Rome, the centre of the world.
Ovid indeed sums up the classic point of view when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
he says that one cannot desire the unknown (<i>ignoti
nulla cupido</i>).<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The essence of nostalgia is the desire
for the unknown. “I was burning with desire,” says
Rousseau, “without any definite object.” One is filled
with a desire to fly one knows not whither, to be off
on a journey into the blue distance.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Music is exalted
by the romanticists above all other arts because it is the
most nostalgic, the art that is most suggestive of the
hopeless gap between the “ideal” and the “real.” “Music,”
in Emerson’s phrase, “pours on mortals its beautiful
disdain.” “Away! away!” cries Jean Paul to Music.
“Thou speakest of things which throughout my endless
life I have found not, and shall not find.” In musical and
other nostalgia, the feelings receive a sort of infinitude
from the coöperation of the imagination; and this infinitude,
this quest of something that must ever elude one,
is at the same time taken to be the measure of one’s
idealism. The symmetry and form that the classicist
gains from working within bounds are no doubt excellent,
but then the willingness to work within bounds betokens
a lack of aspiration. If the primitivist is ready, as some
one has complained, to turn his back on the bright forms
of Olympus and return to the ancient gods of chaos and
of night, the explanation is to be sought in this idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
infinite. It finally becomes a sort of Moloch to which he
is prepared to sacrifice most of the values of civilized life.
The chief fear of the classicist is to be thought monstrous.
The primitivist on the contrary is inclined to see a proof
of superior amplitude of spirit in mere grotesqueness and
disproportion. The creation of monsters is, as Hugo says,
a “satisfaction due to the infinite.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The breaking down by the emotional romanticist of the
barriers that separate not merely the different literary
genres but the different arts is only another aspect of his
readiness to follow the lure of the infinite. The title of
a recent bit of French decadent verse&mdash;“Nostalgia in
Blue Minor”&mdash;would already have been perfectly intelligible
to a Tieck or a Novalis. The Rousseauist&mdash;and
that from a very early stage in the movement&mdash;does
not hesitate to pursue his ever receding dream across all
frontiers, not merely those that separate art from art,
but those that divide flesh from spirit and even good
from evil, until finally he arrives like Blake at a sort of
“Marriage of Heaven and Hell.” When he is not breaking
down barriers in the name of the freedom of the
imagination he is doing so in the name of what he is
pleased to term love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“The ancient art and poetry,” says A. W. Schlegel, “rigorously
separate things which are dissimilar; the romantic delights in indissoluble
mixtures. All contrarieties: nature and art, poetry and prose,
seriousness and mirth, recollection and anticipation, spirituality and
sensuality, terrestrial and celestial, life and death, are by it blended
together in the most intimate combination. As the oldest lawgivers
delivered their mandatory instructions and prescriptions in measured
melodies; as this is fabulously ascribed to Orpheus, the first
softener of the yet untamed race of mortals; in like manner the whole
of the ancient poetry and art is, as it were a <i>rhythmical nomos</i> (law),
an harmonious promulgation of the permanently established legislation
of a world submitted to a beautiful order, and reflecting in itself
the eternal images of things. Romantic poetry, on the other hand, is
the expression of the secret attraction to a chaos which lies concealed
in the very bosom of the ordered universe, and is perpetually striving
after new and marvellous births; the life-giving spirit of primal love
broods here anew on the face of the waters. The former is more
simple, clear, and like to nature in the self-existent perfection of her
separate works; the latter, notwithstanding its fragmentary appearance,
approaches more to the secret of the universe. For Conception
can only comprise each object separately, but nothing in truth can
ever exist separately and by itself; Feeling perceives all in all at one
and the same time.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Note the assumption here that the clear-cut distinctions
of classicism are merely abstract and intellectual, and
that the only true unity is the unity of feeling.</p>

<p>In passages of this kind A. W. Schlegel is little more
than the popularizer of the ideas of his brother Friedrich.
Perhaps no one in the whole romantic movement showed
a greater genius for confusion than Friedrich Schlegel;
no one, in Nietzsche’s phrase, had a more intimate
knowledge of all the bypaths to chaos. Now it is from
the German group of which Friedrich Schlegel was the
chief theorist that romanticism as a distinct and separate
movement takes its rise. We may therefore pause appropriately
at this point to consider briefly how the epithet
romantic of which I have already sketched the early
history came to be applied to a distinct school. In the
latter part of the eighteenth century, it will be remembered,
romantic had become a fairly frequent word in
English and also (under English influence) a less frequent,
though not rare word, in French and German; it
was often used favorably in all these countries as applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to nature, and usually indeed in this sense in France and
Germany; but in England, when applied to human nature
and as the equivalent of the French <i>romanesque</i>, it
had ordinarily an unfavorable connotation; it signified
the “dangerous prevalence of imagination” over “sober
probability,” as may be seen in Foster’s essay “On the
Epithet Romantic.” One may best preface a discussion
of the next step&mdash;the transference of the word to a
distinct movement&mdash;by a quotation from Goethe’s
Conversations with Eckermann (21 March, 1830):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This division of poetry into classic and romantic,” says Goethe,
“which is to-day diffused throughout the whole world and has caused
so much argument and discord, comes originally from Schiller and
me. It was my principle in poetry always to work objectively. Schiller
on the contrary wrote nothing that was not subjective; he thought
his manner good, and to defend it he wrote his article on naïve and
sentimental poetry. … The Schlegels got hold of this idea, developed
it and little by little it has spread throughout the whole world.
Everybody is talking of romanticism and classicism. Fifty years ago
nobody gave the matter a thought.”</p>

</div>

<p>One statement in this passage of Goethe’s is perhaps
open to question&mdash;that concerning the obligation of
the Schlegels, or rather Friedrich Schlegel, to Schiller’s
treatise. A comparison of the date of publication of
the treatise on “Naïve and Sentimental Poetry” with the
date of composition of Schlegel’s early writings would
seem to show that some of Schlegel’s distinctions, though
closely related to those of Schiller, do not derive from
them so immediately as Goethe seems to imply.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Both
sets of views grow rather inevitably out of a primitivistic
or Rousseauistic conception of “nature” that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
epidemic in Germany ever since the Age of Genius. We
need also to keep in mind certain personal traits of
Schlegel if we are to understand the development of his
theories about literature and art. He was romantic, not
only by his genius for confusion, but also one should add,
by his tendency to oscillate violently between extremes.
For him as for Rousseau there was “no intermediary term
between everything and nothing.” One should note here
another meaning that certain romanticists give to the
word “ideal”&mdash;Hazlitt, for example, when he says that
the “ideal is always to be found in extremes.” Every
imaginable extreme, the extreme of reaction as well as
the extreme of radicalism, goes with romanticism; every
genuine mediation between extremes is just as surely
unromantic. Schlegel then was very idealistic in the sense
I have just defined. Having begun as an extreme partisan
of the Greeks, conceived in Schiller’s fashion as a people
that was at once harmonious and instinctive, he passes
over abruptly to the extreme of revolt against every form
of classicism, and then after having posed in works like
his “Lucinde” as a heaven-storming Titan who does not
shrink at the wildest excess of emotional unrestraint, he
passes over no less abruptly to Catholicism and its rigid
outer discipline. This last phase of Schlegel has at least
this much in common with his phase of revolt, that it
carried with it a cult of the Middle Ages. The delicate
point to determine about Friedrich Schlegel and many
other romanticists is why they finally came to place their
land of heart’s desire in the Middle Ages rather than in
Greece. In treating this question one needs to take at least
a glance at the modification that Herder (whose influence
on German romanticism is very great) gave to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
primitivism of Rousseau. Cultivate your genius, Rousseau
said in substance, your ineffable difference from
other men, and look back with longing to the ideal moment
of this genius&mdash;the age of childhood, when your
spontaneous self was not as yet cramped by conventions
or “sicklied o’er by the pale cast of thought.” Cultivate
your national genius, Herder said in substance, and look
back wistfully at the golden beginnings of your nationality
when it was still naïve and “natural,” when poetry
instead of being concocted painfully by individuals was
still the unconscious emanation of the folk. Herder indeed
expands primitivism along these lines into a whole
philosophy of history. The romantic notion of the origin
of the epic springs out of this soil, a notion that is probably
at least as remote from the facts as the neo-classical
notion&mdash;and that is saying a great deal. Any German
who followed Herder in the extension that he gave to
Rousseau’s views about genius and spontaneity could not
only see the folk soul mirrored at least as naïvely in the
“Nibelungenlied” as in the “Iliad,” but by becoming
a mediæval enthusiast he could have the superadded
pleasure of indulging not merely personal but racial
and national idiosyncrasy. Primitivistic mediævalism is
therefore an important ingredient, especially in the case
of Germany, in romantic nationalism&mdash;the type that
has flourished beyond all measure during the past century.
Again, though one might, like Hölderlin, cherish an
infinite longing for the Greeks, the Greeks themselves,
at least the Greeks of Schiller, did not experience longing;
but this fact came to be felt more and more by F.
Schlegel and other romanticists as an inferiority, showing
as it did that they were content with the finite. As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the neo-classicists who were supposed to be the followers
of the Greeks, their case was even worse; they not only
lacked aspiration and infinitude, but were sunk in artificiality,
and had moreover become so analytical that they
must perforce see things in “disconnection dead and
spiritless.” The men of the Middle Ages, on the other
hand, as F. Schlegel saw them, were superior to the neo-classicists
in being naïve; their spontaneity and unity of
feeling had not yet suffered from artificiality, or been
disintegrated by analysis.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> At the same time they were
superior to the Greeks in having aspiration and the
sense of the infinite. The very irregularity of their art
testified to this infinitude. It is not uncommon in the
romantic movement thus to assume that because one has
very little form one must therefore have a great deal
of “soul.” F. Schlegel so extended his definition of the
mediæval spirit as to make it include writers like Shakespeare
and Cervantes, who seemed to him to be vital and
free from formalism. The new nationalism was also made
to turn to the profit of the Middle Ages. Each nation in
shaking off the yoke of classical imitation and getting
back to its mediæval past, was recovering what was
primitive in its own genius, was substituting what was
indigenous for what was alien to it.</p>

<p>The person who did more than any one else to give
international currency to the views of the Schlegels about
classic and romantic and to their primitivistic mediævalism
was Madame de Staël in her book on Germany. It
was with special reference to Madame de Staël and her
influence that Daunou wrote the following passage in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
introduction to La Harpe, a passage that gives curious
evidence of the early attitude of French literary conservatives
towards the new school:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One of the services that he [La Harpe] should render nowadays
is to fortify young people against vain and gothic doctrines which
would reduce the fine arts to childhood if they could ever gain credit
in the land of Racine and Voltaire. La Harpe uttered a warning against
these doctrines when he discovered the first germs of them in the
books of Diderot, Mercier and some other innovators. Yet these
writers were far from having professed fully the barbaric or childish
system which has been taught and developed among us for a few
years past; it is of foreign origin; it had no name in our language and
the name that has been given to it is susceptible in fact of no precise
meaning. Romanticism, for thus it is called, was imported into our
midst along with Kantism, with mysticism and other doctrines of the
same stamp which collectively might be named obscurantism. These
are words which La Harpe was happy enough not to hear. He was
accustomed to too much clearness in his ideas and expression to use
such words or even to understand them. He did not distinguish two
literatures. The literature that nature and society have created for us
and which for three thousand years past has been established and
preserved and reproduced by masterpieces appeared to him alone
worthy of a Frenchman of the eighteenth century. He did not foresee
that it would be reduced some day to being only a particular kind of
literature, tolerated or reproved under the name of classic, and that
its noblest productions would be put on the same level as the formless
sketches of uncultivated genius and untried talents. Yet more than
once decadence has thus been taken for an advance, and a retrograde
movement for progress. Art is so difficult. It is quicker to abandon it
and to owe everything to your genius. … Because perfection calls for
austere toil you maintain that it is contrary to nature. This is a system
that suits at once indolence and vanity. Is anything more needed
to make it popular, especially when it has as auxiliary an obscure
philosophy which is termed transcendent or transcendental? That
is just the way sound literature fell into decline beginning with the
end of the first century of the Christian era. It became extinct only
to revive after a long period of darkness and barbarism; and that is
how it will fall into decline again if great examples and sage lessons
should ever lose their authority.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The general public in England became at least vaguely
aware of the new movement with the translation of
Madame de Staël’s “Germany” (1813) and A. W.
Schlegel’s “Dramatic Art and Literature” (1815).
Byron wrote in his reply to Bowles (1821): “Schlegel
and Madame de Staël have endeavored to reduce poetry
to <i>two</i> systems, classical and romantic. The effect is only
beginning.”</p>

<p>The distinction between classic and romantic worked
out by the Schlegels and spread abroad by Madame de
Staël was, then, largely associated with a certain type
of mediævalism. Nevertheless one cannot insist too
strongly that the new school deserved to be called romantic,
not because it was mediæval, but because it displayed
a certain quality of imagination in its mediævalism.
The longing for the Middle Ages is merely a very
frequent form of nostalgia, and nostalgia I have defined as
the pursuit of pure illusion. No doubt a man may be
mediæval in his leanings and yet very free from nostalgia.
He may, for example, prefer St. Thomas Aquinas to any
modern philosopher on grounds that are the very reverse
of romantic; and in the attitude of any particular
person towards the Middle Ages, romantic and unromantic
elements may be mingled in almost any conceivable
proportion; and the same may be said of any past epoch
that one prefers to the present. Goethe, for instance, as
has been remarked, took flight from his own reality,
but he did not, like the romanticists, take flight from all
reality. The classical world in which Goethe dwelt in
imagination during his latter years, in the midst of a
very unclassical environment, was to some extent at least
real, though one can discern even in the case of Goethe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the danger of a classicism that is too aloof from the here
and now. But the mediævalist, in so far as he is romantic,
does not turn to a mediæval reality from a real but distasteful
present. Here as elsewhere his first requirement
is not that his “vision” should be true, but that it should
be rich and radiant; and the more “ideal” the vision becomes
in this sense, the wider the gap that opens between
poetry and life.</p>

<p>We are thus brought back to the problem of the romantic
imagination or, one may term it, the eccentric imagination.
The classical imagination, I have said, is not free
thus to fly off at a tangent, to wander wild in some empire
of chimeras. It has a centre, it is at work in the service of
reality. With reference to this real centre, it is seeking to
disengage what is normal and representative from the
welter of the actual. It does not evade the actual, but
does select from it and seek to impose upon it something
of the proportion and symmetry of the model to which
it is looking up and which it is imitating. To say that the
classicist (and I am speaking of the classicist at his best)
gets at his reality with the aid of the imagination is but
another way of saying that he perceives his reality only
through a veil of illusion. The creator of this type
achieves work in which illusion and reality are inseparably
blended, work which gives the “illusion of a higher
reality.”</p>

<p>Proportionate and decorous in this sense æsthetic
romanticism can in no wise be, but it does not follow that
the only art of which the Rousseauist is capable is an
art of idyllic dreaming. Schiller makes a remark about
Rousseau that goes very nearly to the heart of the matter:
he is either, says Schiller, dwelling on the delights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
nature or else avenging her. He is either, that is, idyllic
or satirical. Now Rousseau himself says that he was not
inclined to satire and in a sense this is true. He would
have been incapable of lampooning Voltaire in the same
way that Voltaire lampooned him, though one might
indeed wish to be lampooned by Voltaire rather than to
be presented as Rousseau has presented certain persons
in his “Confessions.” In all that large portion of Rousseau’s
writing, however, in which he portrays the polite
society of his time and shows how colorless and corrupt
it is compared with his pastoral dream (for his “nature,”
as I have said, is only a pastoral dream) he is highly
satirical. In general, he is not restrained, at least in the
“Confessions,” from the trivial and even the ignoble
detail by any weak regard for decorum. At best decorum
seems to him a hollow convention, at worst the
“varnish of vice” and the “mask of hypocrisy.” Every
reader of the “Confessions” must be struck by the
presence, occasionally on the same page, of passages
that look forward to Lamartine, and of other passages
that seem an anticipation rather of Zola. The passage
in which Rousseau relates how he was abruptly brought
to earth from his “angelic loves”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> is typical. In short
Rousseau oscillates between an Arcadian vision that is
radiant but unreal, and a photographic and literal and
often sordid reality. He does not so use his imagination
as to disengage the real from the welter of the actual
and so achieve something that strikes one still as nature
but a selected and ennobled nature.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> “It is a very odd
circumstance,” says Rousseau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> “that my imagination is
never more agreeably active than when my outer conditions
are the least agreeable, and that, on the contrary,
it is less cheerful when everything is cheerful about me.
My poor head cannot subordinate itself to things. It
cannot embellish, it wishes to create. Real objects are
reflected in it at best such as they are; it can adorn only
imaginary objects. If I wish to paint the springtime I
must be in winter,” etc.</p>

<p>This passage may be said to foreshadow the two types
of art and literature that have been prevalent since
Rousseau&mdash;romantic art and the so-called realistic
art that tended to supplant it towards the middle of
the nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This so-called realism does not
represent any fundamental change of direction as compared
with the earlier romanticism; it is simply, as some
one has put it, romanticism going on all fours. The
extreme of romantic unreality has always tended to produce
a sharp recoil. As the result of the wandering of
the imagination in its own realm of chimeras, one finally
comes to feel the need of refreshing one’s sense of fact;
and the more trivial the fact, the more certain one is that
one’s feet are once more planted on <i>terra firma</i>. Don
Quixote is working for the triumph of Sancho Panza.
Besides this tendency of one extreme to produce the
other, there are special reasons that I shall point out more
fully later for the close relationship of the romanticism
and the so-called realism of the nineteenth century.
They are both merely different aspects of naturalism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
What binds together realism and romanticism is their
common repudiation of decorum as something external
and artificial. Once get rid of decorum, or what amounts
to the same thing, the whole body of “artificial” conventions,
and what will result is, according to the romanticist,
Arcadia. But what actually emerges with the progressive
weakening of the principle of restraint is <i>la bête
humaine</i>. The Rousseauist begins by walking through the
world as though it were an enchanted garden, and then
with the inevitable clash between his ideal and the real
he becomes morose and embittered. Since men have
turned out not to be indiscriminately good he inclines
to look upon them as indiscriminately bad and to portray
them as such. At the bottom of much so-called realism
therefore is a special type of satire, a satire that is the
product of violent emotional disillusion. The collapse of
the Revolution of 1848 produced a plentiful crop of disillusion
of this kind. No men had ever been more convinced
of the loftiness of their idealism than the Utopists
of this period, or failed more ignominiously when put to
the test. All that remained, many argued, was to turn
from an ideal that had proved so disappointing to the
real, and instead of dreaming about human nature to
observe men as coolly, in Flaubert’s phrase, as though
they were mastodons or crocodiles. But what lurks most
often behind this pretence to a cold scientific impassiveness
in observing human nature is a soured and cynical
emotionalism and a distinctly romantic type of imagination.
The imagination is still idealistic, still straining,
that is, away from the real, only its idealism has undergone
a strange inversion; instead of exaggerating the loveliness
it exaggerates the ugliness of human nature; it finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a sort of morose satisfaction in building for itself not
castles but dungeons in Spain. What I am saying applies
especially to the French realists who are more logical
in their disillusion than the men of other nations. They
often establish the material environment of their heroes
with photographic literalness, but in their dealings with
what should be the specifically human side of these
characters they often resemble Rousseau at his worst:
they put pure logic into the service of pure emotion, and
this is a way of achieving, not the real, but a maximum
of unreality. The so-called realistic writers abound in
extreme examples of the romantic imagination. The
peasants of Zola are not real, they are an hallucination.
If a man is thus to let his imagination run riot, he might,
as Lemaître complains, have imagined something more
agreeable.</p>

<p>The same kinship between realism and romanticism
might be brought out in a writer whom Zola claimed as
his master&mdash;Balzac. I do not refer to the side of Balzac
that is related to what the French call <i>le bas romantisme</i>&mdash;his
lapses into the weird and the melodramatic, his
occasional suggestions of the claptrap of Anne Radcliffe
and the Gothic romance&mdash;but to his general thesis and
his handling of it. Balzac’s attitude towards the society of
his time is, like the attitude of Rousseau towards the
society of his time, satirical, but on entirely different
grounds: he would show the havoc wrought in this society
by its revolutionary emancipation from central control
of the kind that had been provided traditionally by the
monarchy and the Catholic Church, and the consequent
disruption of the family by the violent and egoistic
expansion of the individual along the lines of his ruling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
passion. But Balzac’s imagination is not on the side of
his thesis; not, that is, on the side of the principle of
control; on the contrary, it revels in its vision of a world
in which men are overstepping all ethical bounds in their
quest of power and pleasure, of a purely naturalistic
world that is governed solely by the law of cunning and
the law of force. His imagination is so fascinated by this
vision that, like the imagination of Rousseau, though in
an entirely different way, he simply parts company with
reality. Judged by the ultimate quality of his imagination,
and this, let me repeat, is always the chief thing to
consider in a creative artist, Balzac is a sort of inverted
idealist. Compared with the black fictions he conjures
up in his painting of Paris, the actual Paris seems pale
and insipid. His Paris is not real in short, but an hallucination&mdash;a
lurid land of heart’s desire. As Leslie Stephen
puts it, for Balzac Paris is hell, but then hell is the
only place worth living in. The empire of chimeras over
which he holds sway is about as far on one side of reality
as George Sand’s kingdom of dreams is on the other.
George Sand, more perhaps than any other writer of her
time, continues Rousseau in his purely idyllic manner.
Her idealized peasants are not any further from the truth
and are certainly more agreeable than the peasants of
Balzac, who foreshadow the peasants of Zola.</p>

<p>The writer, however, who shows the conflict between
the romantic imagination and the real better than either
Balzac or Zola, better than any other writer perhaps of
the modern French movement, is Flaubert. The fondness
of this founder of realism for reality may be inferred
from a passage in one of his letters to George Sand:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> “I
had in my very youth a complete presentiment of life.
It was like a sickly kitchen smell escaping from a basement
window.” In his attitude towards the society of his
time, he is, in the same sense, but in a far greater degree
than Rousseau, satirical. The stupidity and mediocrity
of the bourgeois are his target, just as Rousseau’s target
is the artificiality of the drawing-room. At the same time
that he shrinks back with nausea from this reality, Flaubert
is like Gautier “full of nostalgias,” even the nostalgia
of the Middle Ages. “I am a Catholic,” he exclaims,
“I have in my heart something of the green ooze of the
Norman Cathedrals.” Yet he cannot acquiesce in a mediæval
or any other dream. Even Rousseau says that he
was “tormented at times by the nothingness of his chimeras.”
Flaubert was tormented far more by the nothingness
of his. Perhaps indeed the predominant flavor in
Flaubert’s writing as a whole is that of an acrid disillusion.
He portrays satirically the real and at the same time
mocks at the ideal that he craves emotionally and imaginatively
(this is only one of the innumerable forms assumed
by the Rousseauistic warfare between the head
and the heart). He oscillates rapidly between the pole
of realism as he conceives it, and the pole of romance,
and so far as any serious philosophy is concerned, is
left suspended in the void. Madame Bovary is the very
type of the Rousseauistic idealist, misunderstood in
virtue of her exquisite faculty of feeling. She aspires to
a “love beyond all loves,” an infinite satisfaction that
her commonplace husband and environment quite deny
her. At bottom Flaubert’s heart is with Madame Bovary.
“I am Madame Bovary,” he exclaims. Yet he
exposes pitilessly the “nothingness of her chimeras,”
and pursues her to the very dregs of her disillusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I have already mentioned Flaubert’s cult for “Don
Quixote.” His intellectual origins were all there, he
says; he had known it by heart even when a boy. It
has been said that “Madame Bovary” bears the same
relationship to æsthetic romanticism that “Don Quixote”
does to the romanticism of actual adventure of
the Middle Ages. Yet “Don Quixote” is the most
genial, “Madame Bovary” the least genial of masterpieces.
This difference comes out no less clearly in a
comparison of M. Homais with Sancho Panza than in
a comparison of Madame Bovary with the Knight, and
is so fundamental as to throw doubt on the soundness of
the whole analogy.</p>

<p>In M. Homais and like figures Flaubert simply means
to symbolize contemporary life and the immeasurable
abyss of platitude in which it is losing itself through its
lack of imagination and ideal. Yet this same platitude
exercises on him a horrid fascination. For his execration
of the philistine is the nearest approach in his idealism
to a positive content, to an escape from sheer emptiness
and unreality. This execration must therefore be cherished
if he is to remain convinced of his own superiority.
“If it were not for my indignation,” he confesses in one
place, “I should fall flat.” Unfortunately we come to
resemble what we habitually contemplate. “By dint of
railing at idiots,” says Flaubert, “one runs the risk of
becoming idiotic one’s self.”</p>

<p>In his discourse on the “Immortality of the Soul”
(1659) Henry More speaks of “that imagination which
is most free, such as we use in romantic inventions.”
The price that the romantic imagination pays for its
freedom should by this time be obvious: the freer it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the farther it gets away from reality. We have
seen that the special form of unreality encouraged by
the æsthetic romanticism of Rousseau is the dream of the
simple life, the return to a nature that never existed, and
that this dream made its special appeal to an age that
was suffering from an excess of artificiality and conventionalism.
Before entering upon the next stage of our
subject it might be well to consider for a moment wherein
the facts of primitive life, so far as we can ascertain
them, differ from Rousseau’s dream of primitive life;
why we are justified in assuming that the noble savage
of Rousseau, or the Greek of Schiller, or Hölderlin, or the
man of the Middle Ages of Novalis never had any equivalent
in reality. More or less primitive men have existed
and still exist and have been carefully studied. Some of
them actually recall by various traits, their gentleness,
for example, Rousseau’s aboriginal man, and the natural
pity that is supposed to guide him. Why then will any
one familiar with the facts of aboriginal life smile when
Rousseau speaks of the savage “attached to no place,
having no prescribed task, obeying no one, having no
other law than his own will,”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and therefore displaying
independence and initiative? The answer is of course that
genuine savages are, with the possible exception of children,
the most conventional and imitative of beings.
What one takes to be natural in them is often the result
of a long and, in the Rousseauistic sense, artificial
discipline. The tendency to take for pure and unspoiled
nature what is in fact a highly modified nature is one that
assumes many forms. “When you see,” says Rousseau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
“in the happiest people in the world bands of peasants
regulate the affairs of state under an oak-tree and always
behave sensibly, can you keep from despising the refinements
of other nations which make themselves illustrious
and miserable with so much art and mystery?” Rousseau
is viewing these peasants through the Arcadian glamour.
In much the same way Emerson saw a proof of the consonance
of democracy with human nature in the working
of the New England town-meeting. But both Rousseau’s
Swiss and Emerson’s New Englanders had been moulded
by generations of austere religious discipline and so throw
little light on the relation of democracy to human nature
in itself.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar illusion is that of the man who
journeys into a far country and enjoys in the highest
degree the sense of romantic strangeness. He has escaped
from the convention of his own society and is inclined
to look on the men and women he meets in the foreign
land as Arcadian apparitions. But these men and women
have not escaped from <i>their</i> convention. On the contrary,
what most delights him in them (for example,
what most delighted Lafcadio Hearn in the Japanese)
may be the result of an extraordinarily minute and
tyrannical discipline imposed in the name of the general
sense upon the impulses of the individual.</p>

<p>The relation of convention to primitive life is so well
understood nowadays that the Rousseauist has reversed
his argument. Since primitive folk (let us say the Bushmen
of Australia) are more conventional than the Parisian
and Londoner we may infer that at some time in
the future when the ideal is at last achieved upon earth,
conventions will have disappeared entirely. But this is
simply to transfer the Golden Age from the past to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
future, and also to miss the real problem: for there is a
real problem&mdash;perhaps indeed the gravest of all problems&mdash;involved
in the relation of the individual to convention.
If we are to grasp the nature of this problem we
should perceive first of all that the significant contrast
is not that between conditions more or less primitive
and civilization, but that between a civilization that
does not question its conventions and a civilization that
has on the contrary grown self-conscious and critical.
Thus the Homeric Greeks, set up by Schiller as exemplars
of the simple life, were plainly subject to the conventions
of an advanced civilization. The Periclean Greeks
were also highly civilized, but unlike the Homeric
Greeks, were becoming self-conscious and critical. In the
same way the European thirteenth century, in some
respects the most civilized that the world has seen, was
governed by a great convention that imposed very strict
limits upon the liberty of the individual. The critical
spirit was already awake and tugging at the leashes of
the outer authority that confined it, but it did not actually
break them. Dante and St. Thomas Aquinas did not,
for example, inquire into the basis of the mediæval convention
in the same way that Socrates and the sophists
inquired into the traditional opinions of Greece. But in
the eighteenth century, especially in France, and from
that time down to the present day, the revolt against convention
has assumed proportions quite comparable to
anything that took place in ancient Greece. Perhaps no
other age has witnessed so many individuals who were,
like Berlioz, eager to make all traditional barriers crack
in the interest of their “genius” and its full expression.
The state of nature in the name of which Rousseau himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
assailed convention, though in itself only a chimera,
a mere Arcadian projection upon the void, did indeed
tend in a rationalistic pseudo-classic age, to new forms
of imaginative activity. In the form that concerns us
especially the imagination is free to give its magic and
glamour and infinitude to the emancipated emotions.
This type of romanticism did not result in any recovery
of the supposed primitive virtues, but it did bring about
a revaluation of the received notions of morality that
can scarcely be studied too carefully.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">ROMANTIC MORALITY: THE IDEAL</span></h2>

<p>The period that began in the late eighteenth century and
in the midst of which we are still living has witnessed an
almost unparalleled triumph, as I have just said, of the
sense of the individual (<i>sens propre</i>) over the general
sense of mankind (<i>sens commun</i>). Even the collectivistic
schemes that have been opposed to individualism during
this period are themselves, judged by traditional standards,
violently individualistic. Now the word individualism
needs as much as any other general term to be
treated Socratically: we need in the interests of our
present subject to discriminate between different varieties
of individualism. Perhaps as good a working
classification as any is to distinguish three main varieties:
a man may wish to act, or think, or feel, differently
from other men, and those who are individualistic in
any one of these three main ways may have very little
in common with one another. To illustrate concretely,
Milton’s plea in his “Areopagitica” for freedom of conscience
makes above all for individualism of action. (<i>La
foi qui n’agit pas est-ce une foi sincère?</i>) Pierre Bayle, on
the other hand, pleads in his Dictionary and elsewhere
for tolerance, not so much because he wishes to act or
feel in his own way as because he wishes to think his own
thoughts. Rousseau is no less obviously ready to subordinate
both thought and action to sensibility. His message
is summed up once for all in the exclamation of Faust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
“Feeling is all.” He urges war on the general sense only
because of the restrictions it imposes on the free expansion
of his emotions and the enhancing of these emotions
by his imagination.</p>

<p>Now the warfare that Rousseau and the individualists
of feeling have waged on the general sense has meant in
practice a warfare on two great traditions, the classical
and the Christian. I have already pointed out that these
two traditions, though both holding the idea of imitation,
were not entirely in accord with one another, that the
imitation of Horace differs widely from the imitation of
Christ. Yet their diverging from one another is as nothing
compared with their divergence from the individualism of
the primitivist. For the man who imitates Christ in any
traditional sense this world is not an Arcadian dream but
a place of trial and probation. “Take up your cross and
follow me.” The following of this great exemplar required
that the instinctive self, which Rousseau would indulge,
should be either sternly rebuked or else mortified utterly.
So far from Nature and God being one, the natural man
is so corrupt, according to the more austere Christian,
that the gap between him and the divine can be traversed
only by a miracle of grace. He should therefore live in
fear and trembling as befits a being upon whom rests the
weight of the divine displeasure. “It is an humble thing
to be a man.” Humility indeed is, in the phrase of Jeremy
Taylor, the special ornament and jewel of the Christian
religion, and one is tempted to add, of all religion in so
far as it is genuine. Genuine religion must always have in
some form the sense of a deep inner cleft between man’s
ordinary self and the divine. But some Christians were
more inclined from the start, as we can see in the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
forms of the doctrine of grace, to push their humility to
an utter despair of human nature. The historical explanation
of this despair is obvious: it is a sharp rebound
from the pagan riot; an excessive immersion in this
world led to an excess of otherworldliness. At the same
time the conviction as to man’s helplessness was instilled
into those, who, like St. Augustine, had witnessed in
some of its phases the slow disintegration of the Roman
Empire. Human nature had gone bankrupt; and for
centuries it needed to be administered, if I may continue
the metaphor, in receivership. The doctrine of grace was
admirably adapted to this end.</p>

<p>The pagan riot from which the church reacted so
sharply, was not, however, the whole of the ancient
civilization. I have already said that there was at the
heart of this civilization at its best a great idea&mdash;the
idea of proportionateness. The ancients were in short
not merely naturalistic but humanistic, and the idea of
proportion is just as fundamental in humanism as is
humility in religion. Christianity, one scarcely need add,
incorporated within itself, however disdainfully, many
humanistic elements from Greek and Roman culture.
Yet it is none the less true that in his horror at the pagan
worldliness the Christian tended to fly into the opposite
extreme of unworldliness, and in this clash between
naturalism and supernaturalism the purely human
virtues of mediation were thrust more or less into the
background. Yet by its very defect on the humanistic
side the doctrine of grace was perhaps all the better
fitted for the administration of human nature in receivership.
For thus to make man entirely distrustful of himself
and entirely dependent on God, meant in practice to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
make him entirely dependent on the Church. Man became
ignorant and fanatical in the early Christian centuries,
but he also became humble, and in the situation
then existing that was after all the main thing. The
Church as receiver for human nature was thus enabled
to rescue civilization from the wreck of pagan antiquity
and the welter of the barbarian invasions. But by the
very fact that the bases of life in this world gradually
grew more secure man became less otherworldly. He
gradually recovered some degree of confidence in himself.
He gave increasing attention to that side of himself that
the ascetic Christian had repressed. The achievements
of the thirteenth century which mark perhaps the culmination
of Christian civilization were very splendid
not only from a religious but also from a humanistic
point of view. But although the critical spirit was already
beginning to awake, it did not at that time, as I
have already said, actually break away from the tutelage
of the Church.</p>

<p>This emancipation of human nature from theological
restraint took place in far greater measure at the Renaissance.
Human nature showed itself tired of being treated
as a bankrupt, of being governed from without and from
above. It aspired to become autonomous. There was in
so far a strong trend in many quarters towards individualism.
This rupture with external authority meant very
diverse things in practice. For some who, in Lionardo’s
phrase, had caught a glimpse of the antique symmetry
it meant a revival of genuine humanism; for others it
meant rather a revival of the pagan and naturalistic side
of antiquity. Thus Rabelais, in his extreme opposition
to the monkish ideal, already proclaims, like Rousseau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the intrinsic excellence of man, while Calvin and others
attempted to revive the primitive austerity of Christianity
that had been corrupted by the formalism of Rome.
In short, naturalistic, humanistic, and religious elements
are mingled in almost every conceivable proportion in
the vast and complex movement known as the Renaissance;
all these elements indeed are often mingled in the
same individual. The later Renaissance finally arrived
at what one is tempted to call the Jesuitical compromise.
There was a general revamping of dogma and
outer authority, helped forward by a society that had
taken alarm at the excesses of the emancipated individual.
If the individual consented to surrender his moral
autonomy, the Church for its part consented to make
religion comparatively easy and pleasant for him, to
adapt it by casuistry and other devices to a human nature
that was determined once for all to take a less severe
and ascetic view of life. One might thus live inwardly to
a great extent on the naturalistic level while outwardly
going through the motions of a profound piety. There is
an unmistakable analogy between the hollowness of a religion
of this type and the hollowness that one feels in
so much neo-classical decorum. There is also a formalistic
taint in the educational system worked out by the
Jesuits&mdash;a system in all respects so ingenious and in
some respects so admirable. The Greek and especially
the Latin classics are taught in such a way as to become
literary playthings rather than the basis of a philosophy
of life; a humanism is thus encouraged that is external
and rhetorical rather than vital, and this humanism is
combined with a religion that tends to stress submission
to outer authority at the expense of inwardness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
individuality. The reproach has been brought against this
system that it is equally unfitted to form a pagan hero
or a Christian saint. The reply to it was Rousseau’s educational
naturalism&mdash;his exaltation of the spontaneity
and genius of the child.</p>

<p>Voltaire says that every Protestant is a Pope when he
has his Bible in his hand. But in practice Protestantism
has been very far from encouraging so complete a subordination
of the general sense to the sense of the individual.
In the period that elapsed between the first
forward push of individualism in the Renaissance and
the second forward push in the eighteenth century, each
important Protestant group worked out its creed or
convention and knew how to make it very uncomfortable
for any one of its members who rebelled against its
authority. Protestant education was also, like that of the
Jesuits, an attempt to harmonize Christian and classical
elements.</p>

<p>I have already spoken elsewhere of what was menacing
all these attempts, Protestant as well as Catholic, to revive
the principle of authority, to put the general sense
once more on a traditional and dogmatic basis and impose
it on the sense of the individual. The spirit of free
scientific enquiry in the Renaissance had inspired great
naturalists like Kepler and Galileo, and had had its
prophet in Bacon. So far from suffering any setback in
the seventeenth century, science had been adding conquest
to conquest. The inordinate self-confidence of the
modern man would seem to be in large measure an outcome
of this steady advance of scientific discovery, just
as surely as the opposite, the extreme humility that
appears in the doctrine of grace, reflects the despair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
those who had witnessed the disintegration of the Roman
Empire. The word humility, if used at all nowadays,
means that one has a mean opinion of one’s self in comparison
with other men, and not that one perceives the
weakness and nothingness of human nature in itself in
comparison with what is above it. But it is not merely
the self-confidence inspired by science that has undermined
the traditional disciplines, humanistic and religious,
and the attempts to mediate between them on a
traditional basis; it is not merely that science has fascinated
man’s imagination, stimulated his wonder and curiosity
beyond all bounds and drawn him away from the
study of his own nature and its special problems to the
study of the physical realm. What has been even more
decisive in the overthrow of the traditional disciplines
is that science has won its triumphs not by accepting
dogma and tradition but by repudiating them, by dealing
with the natural law, not on a traditional but on a
positive and critical basis. The next step that might
logically have been taken, one might suppose, would have
been to put the human law likewise on a positive and
critical basis. On the contrary the very notion that man
is subject to two laws has been obscured. The truths of
humanism and religion, being very much bound up with
certain traditional forms, have been rejected along with
these forms as obsolescent prejudice, and the attempt
has been made to treat man as entirely the creature of
the natural law. This means in practice that instead of
dying to his ordinary self, as the austere Christian demands,
or instead of imposing a law of decorum upon
his ordinary self, as the humanist demands, man has
only to develop his ordinary self freely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>At the beginning, then, of the slow process that I have
been tracing down in briefest outline from mediæval
Christianity, we find a pure supernaturalism; at the end,
a pure naturalism. If we are to understand the relationship
of this naturalism to the rise of a romantic morality, we
need to go back, as we have done in our study of original
genius, to the England of the early eighteenth century.
Perhaps the most important intermediary stage in the
passage from a pure supernaturalism to a pure naturalism
is the great deistic movement which flourished especially
in the England of this period. Deism indeed is no new
thing. Deistic elements may be found even in the philosophy
of the Middle Ages. But for practical purposes one
does not need in one’s study of deism to go behind English
thinkers like Shaftesbury and his follower Hutcheson.
Shaftesbury is a singularly significant figure. He is
not only the authentic precursor of innumerable naturalistic
moralists in England, France, and Germany, but
one may also trace in his writings the connection between
modern naturalistic morality and ancient naturalistic
morality in its two main forms&mdash;Stoic and Epicurean.
The strict Christian supernaturalist had maintained
that the divine can be known to man only by the outer
miracle of revelation, supplemented by the inner miracle
of grace. The deist maintains, on the contrary, that God
reveals himself also through outer nature which he has
fitted exquisitely to the needs of man, and that inwardly
man may be guided aright by his unaided thoughts
and feelings (according to the predominance of thought
or feeling the deist is rationalistic or sentimental). Man,
in short, is naturally good and nature herself is beneficent
and beautiful. The deist finally pushes this harmony in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
God and man and nature so far that the three are practically
merged. At a still more advanced stage God disappears,
leaving only nature and man as a modification
of nature, and the deist gives way to the pantheist who
may also be either rationalistic or emotional. The pantheist
differs above all from the deist in that he would
dethrone man from his privileged place in creation, which
means in practice that he denies final causes. He no
longer believes, for example, like that sentimental deist
and disciple of Rousseau, Bernardin de St. Pierre, that
Providence has arranged everything in nature with an
immediate eye to man’s welfare; that the markings on
the melon, for instance, “seem to show that it is destined
for the family table.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Rousseau himself, though eschewing this crude appeal
to final causes, scarcely got in theory at least beyond
the stage of emotional deism. The process I have been
describing is illustrated better in some aspects by
Diderot who began as a translator of Shaftesbury and
who later got so far beyond mere deism that he anticipates
the main ideas of the modern evolutionist and
determinist. Diderot is at once an avowed disciple of
Bacon, a scientific utilitarian in short, and also a believer
in the emancipation of the emotions. Rousseau’s attack on
science is profoundly significant for other reasons, but
it is unfortunate in that it obscures the connection that
is so visible in Diderot between the two sides of the naturalistic
movement. If men had not been so heartened
by scientific progress they would have been less ready, we
may be sure, to listen to Rousseau when he affirmed that
they were naturally good. There was another reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
men were eager to be told that they were naturally good
and that they could therefore trust the spontaneous
overflow of their emotions. This reason is to be sought in
the inevitable recoil from the opposite doctrine of total
depravity and the mortal constraint that it had put on
the instincts of the natural man. I have said that many
churchmen, notably the Jesuits, sought to dissimulate
the full austerity of Christian doctrine and thus retain
their authority over a world that was moving away from
austerity and so threatening to escape them. But other
Catholics, notably the Jansenists, as well as Protestants
like the Calvinists, were for insisting to the full on man’s
corruption and for seeking to maintain on this basis
what one is tempted to call a theological reign of terror.
One whole side of Rousseau’s religion can be understood
only as a protest against the type of Christianity that is
found in a Pascal or a Jonathan Edwards. The legend
of the abyss that Pascal saw always yawning at his side
has at least a symbolical value. It is the wont of man to
oscillate violently between extremes, and each extreme
is not only bad in itself but even worse by the opposite
extreme that it engenders. From a God who is altogether
fearful, men are ready to flee to a God who is altogether
loving, or it might be more correct to say altogether
lovely. “Listen, my children,” said Mother Angélique
of Port-Royal to her nuns a few hours before her death,
“listen well to what I say. Most people do not know
what death is, and never give the matter a thought. But
my worst forebodings were as nothing compared with the
terrors now upon me.” In deliberate opposition to such
expressions of the theological terror, Rousseau imagined
the elaborate complacency and self-satisfaction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
dying Julie, whose end was not only calm but æsthetic
(<i>le dernier jour de sa vie en fut aussi le plus charmant</i>).</p>

<p>A sensible member of Edwards’s congregation at
Northampton might conceivably have voted with the
majority to dismiss him, not only because he objected to
this spiritual terrorism in itself, but also because he saw
the opposite extreme that it would help to precipitate&mdash;the
boundless sycophancy of human nature from which
we are now suffering.</p>

<p>The effusiveness, then, that began to appear in the
eighteenth century is one sign of the progress of naturalism,
which is itself due to the new confidence inspired in
man by scientific discovery coupled with a revulsion
from the austerity of Christian dogma. This new effusiveness
is also no less palpably a revulsion from the excess
of artificial decorum and this revulsion was in turn
greatly promoted by the rapid increase in power and
influence at this time of the middle class. Reserve is
traditionally aristocratic. The plebeian is no less traditionally
expansive. It cannot be said that the decorous
reserve of the French aristocracy that had been more
or less imitated by other European aristocracies was in
all respects commendable. According to this decorum
a man should not love his wife, or if he did, should be
careful not to betray the fact in public. It was also good
“form” to live apart from one’s children and bad form
to display one’s affection for them. The protest against
a decorum that repressed even the domestic emotions
may perhaps best be followed in the rise of the middle
class drama. According to strict neo-classic decorum only
the aristocracy had the right to appear in tragedy,
whereas the man of the middle class was relegated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
comedy and the man of the people to farce. The intermediate
types of play that multiply in the eighteenth
century (<i>drame bourgeois</i>, <i>comédie larmoyante</i>, etc.) are
the reply of the plebeian to this classification. He is beginning
to insist that his emotions too shall be taken
seriously. But at the same time he is, under the influence
of the new naturalistic philosophy, so bent on affirming
his own goodness that in getting rid of artificial decorum
he gets rid of true decorum likewise and so strikes at the
very root of the drama. For true drama in contradistinction
to mere melodrama requires in the background a
scale of ethical values, or what amounts to the same
thing, a sense of what is normal and representative and
decorous, and the quality of the characters is revealed
by their responsible choices good or bad with reference
to some ethical scale, choices that the characters reveal
by their actions and not by any explicit moralizing. But
in the middle class drama there is little action in this
sense: no one <i>wills</i> either his goodness or badness, but
appears more or less as the creature of accident or fate
(in a very un-Greek sense), or of a defective social order;
and so instead of true dramatic conflict and proper motivation
one tends to get domestic tableaux in which the
characters weep in unison. For it is understood not only
that man (especially the bourgeois) is good but that the
orthodox way for this goodness to manifest itself is
to overflow through the eyes. Perhaps never before or
since have tears been shed with such a strange facility.
At no other time have there been so many persons who,
with streaming eyes, called upon heaven and earth to
bear witness to their innate excellence. A man would be
ashamed, says La Bruyère, speaking from the point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
view of <i>l’honnête homme</i> and his decorum, to display his
emotions at the theatre. By the time of Diderot he would
have been ashamed not to display them. It had become
almost a requirement of good manners to weep and sob
in public. At the performance of the “Père de Famille”
in 1769 we are told that every handkerchief was in use.
The Revolution seems to have raised doubts as to the
necessary connection between tearfulness and goodness.
The “Père de Famille” was hissed from the stage in 1811.
Geoffroy commented in his feuilleton: “We have learned
by a fatal experience that forty years of declamation
and fustian about sensibility, humanity and benevolence,
have served only to prepare men’s hearts for the last
excesses of barbarism.”</p>

<p>The romanticist indulged in the luxury of grief and
was not incapable of striking an attitude. But as a rule
he disdained the facile lachrymosity of the man of feeling
as still too imitative and conventional. For his part, he
has that within which passes show. To estimate a play
solely by its power to draw tears is, as Coleridge observes,
to measure it by a virtue that it possesses in
common with the onion; and Chateaubriand makes a
similar observation. Yet one should not forget that the
romantic emotionalist derives directly from the man of
feeling. One may indeed study the transition from the
one to the other in Chateaubriand himself. For example,
in his early work the “Natchez” he introduces a tribe
of Sioux Indians who are still governed by the natural
pity of Rousseau, as they prove by weeping on the slightest
occasion. Lamartine again is close to Rousseau when
he expatiates on the “genius” that is to be found in a
tear; and Musset is not far from Diderot when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
exclaims, “Long live the melodrama at which Margot
wept” (<i>Vive le mélodrame où Margot a pleuré</i>).</p>

<p>Though it is usual to associate this effusiveness with
Rousseau it should be clear from my brief sketch of the
rise of the forces that were destined to overthrow the
two great traditions&mdash;the Christian tradition with its
prime emphasis on humility and the classical with its
prime emphasis on decorum&mdash;that Rousseau had many
forerunners. It would be easy enough, for example, to
cite from English literature of the early eighteenth-century
domestic tableaux<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that look forward equally to
the middle class drama and to Rousseau’s picture of the
virtues of Julie as wife and mother. Yet Rousseau, after
all, deserves his preëminent position as the arch-sentimentalist
by the very audacity of his revolt in the name
of feeling from both humility and decorum. Never before
and probably never since has a man of such undoubted
genius shown himself so lacking in humility and
decency (to use the old-fashioned synonym for decorum)
as Rousseau in the “Confessions.” Rousseau feels himself
so good that he is ready as he declares to appear before
the Almighty at the sound of the trump of the last
judgment, with the book of his “Confessions” in his
hand, and there to issue a challenge to the whole human
race: “Let a single one assert to Thee if he dare: I am
better than that man.” As Horace Walpole complains
he meditates a gasconade for the end of the world. It is
possible to maintain with M. Lemaître that Rousseau’s
character underwent a certain purification as he grew
older, but never at any time, either at the beginning or
at the end, is it possible, as M. Lemaître admits, to detect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
an atom of humility&mdash;an essential lack that had already
been noted by Burke.</p>

<p>The affront then that Rousseau puts upon humility
at the very opening of his “Confessions” has like so much
else in his life and writings a symbolical value. He also
declares war in the same passage in the name of what he
conceives to be his true self&mdash;that is his emotional self&mdash;against
decorum or decency. I have already spoken
of one of the main objections to decorum: it keeps one
tame and conventional and interferes with the explosion
of original genius. Another and closely allied grievance
against decorum is implied in Rousseau’s opening assertion
in the Confessions that his aim is to show a man in
all the truth of his nature, and human nature can be
known in its truth only, it should seem, when stripped of
its last shred of reticence. Rousseau therefore already
goes on the principle recently proclaimed by the Irish
Bohemian George Moore, that the only thing a man
should be ashamed of is of being ashamed. If the first
objection to decorum&mdash;that it represses original genius&mdash;was
urged especially by the romanticists, the second
objection&mdash;that decorum interferes with truth to
nature&mdash;was urged especially by the so-called realists
of the later nineteenth century (and realism of this type
is, as has been said, only romanticism going on all fours).
Between the Rousseauistic conception of nature and that
of the humanist the gap is especially wide. The humanist
maintains that man attains to the truth of his nature
only by imposing decorum upon his ordinary self. The
Rousseauist maintains that man attains to this truth
only by the free expansion of his ordinary self. The humanist
fears to let his ordinary self unfold freely at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
expense of decorum lest he merit some such comment
as that made on the “Confessions” by Madame de Boufflers
who had been infatuated with Rousseau during his
lifetime: that it was the work not of a man but of an
unclean animal.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The passages of the “Confessions” that deserve this verdict
do not, it is hardly necessary to add, reflect directly
Rousseau’s moral ideal. In his dealings with morality as
elsewhere he is, to come back to Schiller’s distinction,
partly idyllic and partly satirical. He is satiric in his
attitude towards the existing forms&mdash;forms based upon
the Christian tradition that man is naturally sinful and
that he needs therefore the discipline of fear and humility,
or else forms based upon the classical tradition that
man is naturally one-sided and that he needs therefore
to be disciplined into decorum and proportionateness.
He is idyllic in the substitutes that he would offer for
these traditional forms. The substitutes are particularly
striking in their refusal to allow any place for fear.
Fear, according to Ovid, created the first Gods, and religion
has been defined by an old English poet as the
“mother of form and fear.” Rousseau would put in the
place of form a fluid emotionalism, and as for fear, he
would simply cast it out entirely, a revulsion, as I have
pointed out, from the excessive emphasis on fear in
the more austere forms of Christianity. Be “natural,”
Rousseau says, and eschew priests and doctors, and
you will be emancipated from fear.</p>

<p>Rousseau’s expedient for getting rid of man’s sense of
his own sinfulness on which fear and humility ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
rest is well known. Evil, says Rousseau, foreign to man’s
constitution, is introduced into it from without. The burden
of guilt is thus conveniently shifted upon society.
Instead of the old dualism between good and evil in the
breast of the individual, a new dualism is thus set up
between an artificial and corrupt society and “nature.”
For man, let me repeat, has, according to Rousseau,
fallen from nature in somewhat the same way as in the
old theology he fell from God, and it is here that the
idyllic element comes in, for, let us remind ourselves
once more, Rousseau’s nature from which man has fallen
is only an Arcadian dream.</p>

<p>The assertion of man’s natural goodness is plainly something
very fundamental in Rousseau, but there is something
still more fundamental, and that is the shifting of
dualism itself, the virtual denial of a struggle between
good and evil in the breast of the individual. That deep
inner cleft in man’s being on which religion has always
put so much emphasis is not genuine. Only get away
from an artificial society and back to nature and the inner
conflict which is but a part of the artificiality will give
way to beauty and harmony. In a passage in his “Supplément
au voyage de Bougainville,” Diderot puts the
underlying thesis of the new morality almost more
clearly than Rousseau: “Do you wish to know in brief
the tale of almost all our woe? There once existed a
natural man; there has been introduced within this man
an artificial man and there has arisen in the cave a civil
war which lasts throughout life.”</p>

<p>The denial of the reality of the “civil war in the cave”
involves an entire transformation of the conscience. The
conscience ceases to be a power that sits in judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
on the ordinary self and inhibits its impulses. It tends
so far as it is recognized at all, to become itself an instinct
and an emotion. Students of the history of ethics
scarcely need to be told that this transformation of the
conscience was led up to by the English deists, especially
by Shaftesbury and his disciple Hutcheson.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Shaftesbury
and Hutcheson are already æsthetic in all senses of the
word; æsthetic in that they tend to base conduct upon
feeling, and æsthetic in that they incline to identify the
good and the beautiful. Conscience is ceasing for both
of them to be an inner check on the impulses of the individual
and becoming a moral <i>sense</i>, a sort of expansive
instinct for doing good to others. Altruism, as thus conceived,
is opposed by them to the egoism of Hobbes and
his followers.</p>

<p>But for the full implications of this transformation of
conscience and for æsthetic morality in general one
needs to turn to Rousseau. Most men according to Rousseau
are perverted by society, but there are a few in
whom the voice of “nature” is still strong and who, to be
good and at the same time beautiful, have only to let
themselves go. These, to use a term that came to have
in the eighteenth century an almost technical meaning,
are the “beautiful souls.” The <i>belle âme</i> is practically
indistinguishable from the <i>âme sensible</i> and has many
points in common with the original genius. Those whose
souls are beautiful are a small transfigured band in the
midst of a philistine multitude. They are not to be
judged by the same rules as those of less exquisite sensibility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
“There are unfortunates too privileged to follow
the common pathway.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The beautiful soul is unintelligible
to those of coarser feelings. His very superiority,
his preternatural fineness of sensation, thus predestines
him to suffering. We are here at the root of romantic
melancholy as will appear more fully later.</p>

<p>The most important aspect of the whole conception is,
however, the strictly ethical&mdash;the notion that the beautiful
soul has only to be instinctive and temperamental
to merit the praise that has in the past been awarded
only to the purest spirituality. “As for Julie,” says Rousseau,
“who never had any other guide but her heart and
could have no surer guide, she gives herself up to it without
scruple, and to do right, has only to do all that it
asks of her.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Virtue indeed, according to Rousseau, is
not merely an instinct but a passion and even a voluptuous
passion, moving in the same direction as other passions,
only superior to them in vehemence. “Cold reason
has never done anything illustrious; and you can triumph
over the passions only by opposing them to one another.
When the passion of virtue arises, it dominates everything
and holds everything in equipoise.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>This notion of the soul that is spontaneously beautiful
and therefore good made an especial appeal to the Germans
and indeed is often associated with Germany more
than with any other land.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> But examples of moral æstheticism
are scarcely less frequent elsewhere from Rousseau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to the present. No one, for example, was ever more
convinced of the beauty of his own soul than Renan.
“Morality,” says Renan, “has been conceived up to the
present in a very narrow spirit, as obedience to a law,
as an inner struggle between opposite laws. As for me,
I declare that when I do good I obey no one, I fight no
battle and win no victory. The cultivated man has only
to follow the delicious incline of his inner impulses.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Therefore, as he says elsewhere, “Be beautiful and then
do at each moment whatever your heart may inspire
you to do. This is the whole of morality.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The doctrine of the beautiful soul is at once a denial and
a parody of the doctrine of grace; a denial because it
rejects original sin; a parody because it holds that the
beautiful soul acts aright, not through any effort of its
own but because nature acts in it and through it even as
a man in a state of grace acts aright not through any
merit of his own but because God acts in him and through
him. The man who saw everything from the angle of
grace was, like the beautiful soul or the original genius,
inclined to look upon himself as exceptional and superlative.
Bunyan entitles the story of his own inner life
“Grace abounding to the chief of sinners.” But Bunyan
flatters himself. It is not easy to be chief in such a lively
competition. Humility and pride were evidently in a
sort of grapple with one another in the breast of the
Jansenist who declared that God had killed three men
in order to compass his salvation. In the case of the beautiful
soul the humility disappears, but the pride remains.
He still looks upon himself as superlative but superlative
in goodness. If all men were like himself, Renan declares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
it would be appropriate to say of them: Ye are Gods and
sons of the most high.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The partisan of grace holds that
works are of no avail compared with the gratuitous and
unmerited illumination from above. The beautiful soul
clings to his belief in his own innate excellence, no matter
how flagrant the contradiction may be between this
belief and his deeds. One should not fail to note some
approximation to the point of view of the beautiful soul
in those forms of Christianity in which the sense of sin
is somewhat relaxed and the inner light very much
emphasized&mdash;for example among the German pietists
and the quietists of Catholic countries.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> We even hear
of persons claiming to be Christians who as the result
of debauchery have experienced a spiritual awakening
(<i>Dans la brute assoupie, un ange se réveille</i>). But such doctrines
are mere excrescences and eccentricities in the
total history of Christianity. Even in its extreme insistence
on grace, Christianity has always tended to supplement
rather than contradict the supreme maxim of
humanistic morality as enunciated by Cicero: “The
whole praise of virtue is in action.” The usual result of
the doctrine of grace when sincerely held is to make a
man feel desperately sinful at the same time that he is
less open to reproach than other men in his actual behavior.
The beautiful soul on the other hand can always
take refuge in his feelings from his real delinquencies.
According to Joubert, Chateaubriand was not disturbed
by actual lapses in his conduct because of his persuasion
of his own innate rectitude.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> “Her conduct was reprehensible,”
says Rousseau of Madame de Warens, “but her
heart was pure.” It does not matter what you do if only
through it all you preserve the sense of your own loveliness.
Indeed the more dubious the act the more copious
would seem to be the overflow of fine sentiments to
which it stimulates the beautiful soul. Rousseau dilates
on his “warmth of heart,” his “keenness of sensibility,”
his “innate benevolence for his fellow creatures,” his
“ardent love for the great, the true, the beautiful, the
just,” on the “melting feeling, the lively and sweet emotion
that he experiences at the sight of everything that
is virtuous, generous and lovely,” and concludes: “And
so my third child was put into the foundling hospital.”</p>

<p>If we wish to see the psychology of Rousseau writ
large we should turn to the French Revolution. That
period abounds in persons whose goodness is in theory
so superlative that it overflows in a love for all men, but
who in practice are filled like Rousseau in his later years
with universal suspicion. There was indeed a moment in
the Revolution when the madness of Rousseau became
epidemic, when suspicion was pushed to such a point
that men became “suspect of being suspect.” One of
the last persons to see Rousseau alive at Ermenonville
was Maximilien Robespierre. He was probably a more
thoroughgoing Rousseauist than any other of the Revolutionary
leaders. Perhaps no passage that could be cited
illustrates with more terrible clearness the tendency of
the new morality to convert righteousness into self-righteousness
than the following from his last speech
before the Convention at the very height of the Reign of
Terror. Himself devoured by suspicion, he is repelling
the suspicion that he wishes to erect his own power on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the ruins of the monarchy. The idea, he says, that “he
can descend to the infamy of the throne will appear
probable only to those perverse beings who have not
even the right to believe in virtue. But why speak of
virtue? Doubtless virtue is a natural passion. But how
could they be familiar with it, these venal spirits who
never yielded access to aught save cowardly and ferocious
passions? … Yet virtue exists as you can testify, feeling
and pure souls; it exists, that tender, irresistible, imperious
passion, torment and delight of magnanimous hearts,
that profound horror of tyranny, that compassionate
zeal for the oppressed, that sacred love for one’s country,
that still more sublime and sacred love for humanity,
without which a great revolution is only a glittering
crime that destroys another crime; it exists, that generous
ambition to found on earth the first Republic of the
world; that egoism of undegenerate men who find a
celestial voluptuousness in the calm of a pure conscience
and the ravishing spectacle of public happiness(!).
You feel it at this moment burning in your souls. I feel
it in mine. But how could our vile calumniators have any
notion of it?” etc.</p>

<p>In Robespierre and other revolutionary leaders one
may study the implications of the new morality&mdash;the
attempt to transform virtue into a natural passion&mdash;not
merely for the individual but for society. M. Rod
entitled his play on Rousseau “The Reformer.” Both
Rousseau and his disciple Robespierre were reformers in
the modern sense,&mdash;that is they are concerned not with
reforming themselves, but other men. Inasmuch as there
is no conflict between good and evil in the breast of the
beautiful soul he is free to devote all his efforts to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
improvement of mankind, and he proposes to achieve this
great end by diffusing the spirit of brotherhood. All the
traditional forms that stand in the way of this free emotional
expansion he denounces as mere “prejudices,”
and inclines to look on those who administer these forms
as a gang of conspirators who are imposing an arbitrary
and artificial restraint on the natural goodness of man
and so keeping it from manifesting itself. With the final
disappearance of the prejudices of the past and those
who base their usurped authority upon them, the Golden
Age will be ushered in at last; everybody will be boundlessly
self-assertive and at the same time temper this
self-assertion by an equally boundless sympathy for
others, whose sympathy and self-assertion likewise know
no bounds. The world of Walt Whitman will be realized,
a world in which there is neither inferior nor superior but
only comrades. This vision (such for example as appears
at the end of Shelley’s “Prometheus”) of a humanity released
from all evil artificially imposed from without, a
humanity “where all things flow to all, as rivers to the
sea” and “whose nature is its own divine control,” is the
true religion of the Rousseauist. It is this image of a humanity
glorified through love that he sets up for worship
in the sanctuary left vacant by “the great absence of
God.”</p>

<p>This transformation of the Arcadian dreamer into the
Utopist is due in part, as I have already suggested, to
the intoxication produced in the human spirit by the
conquests of science. One can discern the coöperation
of Baconian and Rousseauist from a very early stage of
the great humanitarian movement in the midst of which
we are still living. Both Baconian and Rousseauist are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
interested not in the struggle between good and evil in
the breast of the individual, but in the progress of mankind
as a whole. If the Rousseauist hopes to promote the
progress of society by diffusing the spirit of brotherhood
the Baconian or utilitarian hopes to achieve the same end
by perfecting its machinery. It is scarcely necessary to
add that these two main types of humanitarianism may
be contained in almost any proportion in any particular
person. By his worship of man in his future material
advance, the Baconian betrays no less surely than the
Rousseauist his faith in man’s natural goodness. This
lack of humility is especially conspicuous in those who
have sought to develop the positive observations of
science into a closed system with the aid of logic and
pure mathematics. Pascal already remarked sarcastically
of Descartes that he had no need of God except to give
an initial fillip to his mechanism. Later the mechanist no
longer grants the need of the initial fillip. According to
the familiar anecdote, La Place when asked by Napoleon
in the course of an explanation of his “Celestial Mechanics”
where God came in, replied that he had no need of a
God in his system. As illustrating the extreme of humanitarian
arrogance one may take the following from the
physicist and mathematician, W. K. Clifford:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> “The
dim and shadowy outlines of the superhuman deity fade
slowly from before us; and as the mist of his presence
floats aside, we perceive with greater and greater clearness
the shape of a yet grander and nobler figure&mdash;of
Him who made all gods and shall unmake them. From
the dim dawn of history and from the inmost depths of
every soul the face of our father Man looks out upon
us with the fire of eternal youth in his eyes and says,
‘Before Jehovah was, I am.’” The fire, one is tempted to
say, of eternal lust! Clifford is reported to have once
hung by his toes from the cross-bar of a weathercock on
a church-tower. As a bit of intellectual acrobatics the
passage I have just quoted has some analogy with this
posture. Further than this, man’s intoxication with
himself is not likely to go. The attitude of Clifford is
even more extreme in its way than that of Jonathan
Edwards in his. However, there are already signs that
the man of science is becoming, if not humble, at least a
trifle less arrogant.</p>

<p>One can imagine the Rousseauist interrupting at this
point to remark that one of his chief protests has always
been against the mechanical and utilitarian and in general
the scientific attitude towards life. This is true.
Something has already been said about this protest and
it will be necessary to say more about it later. Yet
Rousseauist and Baconian agree, as I have said, in turning
away from the “civil war in the cave” to humanity
in the lump. They agree in being more or less rebellious
towards the traditional forms that put prime emphasis
on the “civil war in the cave”&mdash;whether the Christian
tradition with its humility or the classical with its decorum.
No wonder Prometheus was the great romantic
hero. Prometheus was at once a rebel, a lover of man
and a promoter of man’s material progress. We have
been living for over a century in what may be termed
an age of Promethean individualism.</p>

<p>The Rousseauist especially feels an inner kinship with
Prometheus and other Titans. He is fascinated by every
form of insurgency. Cain and Satan are both romantic
heroes. To meet the full romantic requirement, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the insurgent must also be tender-hearted. He must
show an elemental energy in his explosion against the
established order and at the same time a boundless
sympathy for the victims of it. One of Hugo’s poems tells
of a Mexican volcano, that in sheer disgust at the cruelty
of the members of the Inquisition, spits lava upon them.
This compassionate volcano symbolizes in both of its main
aspects the romantic ideal. Hence the enormous international
popularity of Schiller’s “Robbers.” One may
find innumerable variants of the brigand Karl Moor who
uses his plunder “to support meritorious young men at
college.” The world into which we enter from the very
dawn of romanticism is one of “glorious rascals,” and
“beloved vagabonds.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sublime convicts,” says M. Lasserre, “idlers of genius, angelic
female poisoners, monsters inspired by God, sincere comedians,
virtuous courtesans, metaphysical mountebanks, faithful adulterers,
form only one half&mdash;the sympathetic half of humanity according to
romanticism. The other half, the wicked half, is manufactured by the
same intellectual process under the suggestion of the same revolutionary
instinct. It comprises all those who hold or stand for a portion of
any discipline whatsoever, political, religious, moral or intellectual&mdash;kings,
ministers, priests, judges, soldiers, policemen, husbands and
critics.”<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Rousseauist is ever ready to discover beauty of
soul in any one who is under the reprobation of society.
The figure of the courtesan rehabilitated through love
that has enjoyed such popularity during the past
hundred years goes back to Rousseau himself.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The
underlying assumption of romantic morality is that the
personal virtues, the virtues that imply self-control,
count as naught compared with the fraternal spirit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the readiness to sacrifice one’s self for others. This is the
ordinary theme of the Russian novel in which one finds,
as Lemaître remarks, “the Kalmuck exaggerations of
our French romantic ideas.” For example Sonia in
“Crime and Punishment” is glorified because she prostitutes
herself to procure a livelihood for her family.
One does not however need to go to Russia for what is
scarcely less the assumption of contemporary America.
If it can only be shown that a person is sympathetic we
are inclined to pardon him his sins of unrestraint, his
lack, for example, of common honesty. As an offset to
the damaging facts brought out at the investigation of
the sugar trust, the defense sought to establish that the
late H. O. Havemeyer was a beautiful soul. It was testified
that he could never hear little children sing without
tears coming into his eyes. His favorite song, some one
was unkind enough to suggest, was “little drops of water,
little grains of sand.” The newspapers again reported
not long ago that a notorious Pittsburg grafter had petitioned
for his release from the penitentiary on the
grounds that he wished to continue his philanthropic
activities among the poor. Another paragraph that
appeared recently in the daily press related that a burglar
while engaged professionally in a house at Los
Angeles discovered that the lady of the house had a child
suffering from croup, and at once came to her aid, explaining
that he had six children of his own. No one could
really think amiss of this authentic descendant of
Schiller’s Karl Moor. For love, according to the Rousseauist,
is not the fulfillment of the law but a substitute
for it. In “Les Misérables” Hugo contrasts Javert who
stands for the old order based on obedience to the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
with the convict Jean Valjean who stands for the new
regeneration of man through love and self-sacrifice.
When Javert awakens to the full ignominy of his rôle
he does the only decent thing&mdash;he commits suicide.
Hugo indeed has perhaps carried the new evangel of
sympathy as a substitute for all the other virtues further
than any one else and with fewer weak concessions to
common sense. Sultan Murad, Hugo narrates, was “sublime.”
He had his eight brothers strangled, caused his
uncle to be sawn in two between two planks, opened one
after the other twelve children to find a stolen apple,
shed an ocean of blood and “sabred the world.” One day
while passing in front of a butcher-shop he saw a pig
bleeding to death, tormented by flies and with the sun
beating upon its wound. Touched by pity, the Sultan
pushes the pig into the shade with his foot and with an
“enormous and superhuman gesture” drives away the
flies. When Murad dies the pig appears before the
Almighty and, pleading for him against the accusing
host of his victims, wins his pardon. Moral: “A succored
pig outweighs a world oppressed”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> (<i>Un pourceau
secouru vaut un monde égorgé</i>).</p>

<p>This subordination of all the other values of life to
sympathy is achieved only at the expense of the great
humanistic virtue&mdash;decorum or a sense of proportion.
Now not to possess a sense of proportion is, however
this lack may be manifested, to be a pedant; and, if
there is ever a humanistic reaction, Hugo, one of the
chief products of the age of original genius, will scarcely
escape the charge of pedantry. But true religion also insists
on a hierarchy of the virtues. Burke speaks at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
as much from a religious as from a humanistic point of
view when he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The greatest crimes do not arise so much from a want of feeling for
others as from an over-sensibility for ourselves and an over-indulgence
to our own desires. … They [the ‘philosophes’] explode or render
odious or contemptible that class of virtues which restrain the appetite.
These are at least nine out of ten of the virtues. In the place of
all this they substitute a virtue which they call humanity or benevolence.
By these means their morality has no idea in it of restraint or
indeed of a distinct and settled principle of any kind. When their
disciples are thus left free and guided only by present feeling, they
are no longer to be depended on for good and evil. The men who to-day
snatch the worst criminals from justice will murder the most
innocent persons to-morrow.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The person who seeks to get rid of ninety per cent of
the virtues in favor of an indiscriminate sympathy does
not simply lose his scale of values. He arrives at an
inverted scale of values. For the higher the object for
which one feels sympathy the more the idea of obligation
is likely to intrude&mdash;the very thing the Rousseauist is
seeking to escape. One is more irresponsible and therefore
more spontaneous in the Rousseauistic sense in lavishing
one’s pity on a dying pig. Medical men have given a
learned name to the malady of those who neglect the
members of their own family and gush over animals
(zoöphilpsychosis). But Rousseau already exhibits this
“psychosis.” He abandoned his five children one after the
other, but had we are told an unspeakable affection for
his dog.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Rousseau’s contemporary, Sterne, is supposed to have
lavished a somewhat disproportionate emotion upon an
ass. But the ass does not really come into his own until
a later stage of the movement. Nietzsche has depicted
the leaders of the nineteenth century as engaged in a
veritable onolatry or ass-worship. The opposition between
neo-classicist and Rousseauist is indeed symbolized
in a fashion by their respective attitude towards the
ass. Neo-classical decorum was, it should be remembered,
an all-pervading principle. It imposed a severe hierarchy,
not only upon objects, but upon the words that express
these objects. The first concern of the decorous person
was to avoid lowness, and the ass he looked upon as hopelessly
low&mdash;so low as to be incapable of ennoblement
even by a resort to periphrasis. Homer therefore was
deemed by Vida to have been guilty of outrageous indecorum
in comparing Ajax to an ass. The partisans of
Homer sought indeed to prove that the ass was in the
time of Homer a “noble” animal or at least that the word
ass was “noble.” But the stigma put upon Homer by
Vida&mdash;reinforced as it was by the similar attacks of
Scaliger and others&mdash;remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The rehabilitation of the ass by the Rousseauist is at
once a protest against an unduly squeamish decorum, and
a way of proclaiming the new principle of unbounded
expansive sympathy. In dealing with both words and
what they express, one should show a democratic inclusiveness.
Something has already been said of the war
the romanticist waged in the name of local color against
the impoverishment of vocabulary by the neo-classicists.
But the romantic warfare against the aristocratic
squeamishness of the neo-classic vocabulary goes perhaps
even deeper. Take, for instance, Wordsworth’s view
as to the proper language of poetry. Poetical decorum
had become by the end of the eighteenth century a
mere varnish of conventional elegance. Why should
mere polite prejudice, so Wordsworth reasoned, and the
“gaudiness and inane phraseology” in which it resulted
be allowed to interfere with the “spontaneous overflow of
powerful emotion”? And so he proceeds to set up a view
of poetry that is only the neo-classical view turned upside
down. For the proper subjects and speech of poetry he
would turn from the highest class of society to the lowest,
from the aristocrat to the peasant. The peasant is more
poetical than the aristocrat because he is closer to nature,
for Wordsworth as he himself avows, is less interested
in the peasant for his own sake than because he sees in
him a sort of emanation of the landscape.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>One needs to keep all this background in mind if one
wishes to understand the full significance of a poem like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
“Peter Bell.” Scaliger blames Homer because he stoops
to mention in his description of Zeus something so trivial
as the eyebrows. Wordsworth seeks to bestow poetical
dignity and seriousness on the “long left ear” of an ass.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
The ass is thus exalted one scarcely need add, because of
his compassionateness. The hard heart of Peter Bell is at
last melted by the sight of so much goodness. He aspires
to be like the ass and finally achieves his wish.</p>

<p>The French romanticists, Hugo, for instance, make an
attack on decorum somewhat similar to that of Wordsworth.
Words formerly lived, says Hugo, divided up
into castes. Some had the privilege of mounting into the
king’s coaches at Versailles, whereas others were relegated
to the rabble. I came along and clapped a red
liberty cap on the old dictionary. I brought about a
literary ’93,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> etc. Hugo’s attack on decorum is also combined
with an even more violent assertion than Wordsworth’s
of the ideal of romantic morality&mdash;the supremacy
of pity. He declares in the “Legend of the
Ages” that an ass that takes a step aside to avoid
crushing a toad is “holier than Socrates and greater
than Plato.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> For this and similar utterances Hugo
deserves to be placed very nearly if not quite at the
head of romantic onolaters.</p>

<p>We have said that the tremendous burden put upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
sympathy in romantic morality is a result of the assumption
that the “civil war in the cave” is artificial and that
therefore the restraining virtues (according to Burke
ninety per cent of the virtues) which imply this warfare
are likewise artificial. If the civil war in the cave should
turn out to be not artificial but a fact of the gravest import,
the whole spiritual landscape would change immediately.
Romantic morality would in that case be not a
reality but a mirage. We need at all events to grasp the
central issue firmly. Humanism and religion have always
asserted in some form or other the dualism of the human
spirit. A man’s spirituality is in inverse ratio to his
immersion in temperament. The whole movement from
Rousseau to Bergson is, on the other hand, filled with the
glorification of instinct. To become spiritual the beautiful
soul needs only to expand along the lines of temperament
and with this process the cult of pity or sympathy does not
interfere. The romantic moralist tends to favor expansion
on the ground that it is vital, creative, infinite, and to dismiss
whatever seems to set bounds to expansion as something
inert, mechanical, finite. In its onslaughts on the
veto power whether within or without the breast of the
individual it is plain that no age has ever approached the
age of original genius in the midst of which we are still
living. Goethe defines the devil as the spirit that always
says no, and Carlyle celebrates his passage from darkness
to light as an escape from the Everlasting Nay to the
Everlasting Yea. We rarely pause to consider what a
reversal of traditional wisdom is implied in such conceptions.
In the past, the spirit that says no has been
associated rather with the divine. Socrates tells us that
the counsels of his “voice” were always negative, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
positive.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> According to the ancient Hindu again the divine
is the “inner check.” God, according to Aristotle, is
pure Form. In opposition to all this emphasis on the restricting
and limiting power, the naturalist, whether scientific
or emotional, sets up a program of formless, fearless
expansion; which means in practice that he recognizes
no bounds either to intellectual or emotional curiosity.</p>

<p>I have said that it is a part of the psychology of the
original genius to offer the element of wonder and surprise
awakened by the perpetual novelty, the infinite
otherwiseness of things, as a substitute for the awe that
is associated with their infinite oneness; or rather to
refuse to discriminate between these two infinitudes and
so to confound the two main directions of the human
spirit, its religious East, as one may say, with its West
of wonder and romance. This confusion may be illustrated
by the romantic attitude towards what is perhaps
the most Eastern of all Eastern lands,&mdash;India. The
materials for the study of India in the Occident were
accumulated by Englishmen towards the end of the
eighteenth century, but the actual interpretation of this
material is due largely to German romanticists, notably
to Friedrich Schlegel.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Alongside the romantic Hellenist
and the romantic mediævalist we find the romantic
Indianist. It is to India even more than to Spain that
one needs to turn, says Friedrich Schlegel, for the
supremely romantic<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>&mdash;that is, the wildest and most
unrestrained luxuriance of imagination. Now in a country
so vast and so ancient as India you can find in some place
or at some period or other almost anything you like.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
If, for example, W. B. Yeats waxes enthusiastic over
Tagore we may be sure that there is in the work of
Tagore something akin to æsthetic romanticism. But if
we take India at the top of her achievement in the early
Buddhistic movement, let us say, we shall find something
very different. The early Buddhistic movement in its
essential aspects is at the extreme opposite pole from
romanticism. The point is worth making because certain
misinterpretations that still persist both of Buddhism
and other movements in India can be traced ultimately
to the bad twist that was given to the whole subject by
romanticists like the Schlegels. The educated Frenchman,
for instance, gets his ideas of India largely from
certain poems of Leconte de Lisle who reflects the
German influence. But the sense of universal and meaningless
flux that pervades these poems without any
countervailing sense of a reality behind the shows of
nature is a product of romanticism, working in coöperation
with science, and is therefore antipodal to the
absorption of the true Hindu in the oneness of things.
We are told, again, that Schopenhauer was a Buddhist.
Did he not have an image of Buddha in his bedroom?
But no doctrine perhaps is more remote from the genuine
doctrine of Buddha than that of this soured and disillusioned
romanticist. The nature of true Buddhism and its
opposition to all forms of romanticism is worth dwelling
on for a moment. Buddha not only asserted the human
law with unusual power but he also did what, in the
estimation of some, needs doing in our own day&mdash;he put
this law, not on a traditional, but on a positive and critical
basis. This spiritual positivism of Buddha is, reduced to
its simplest terms, a psychology of desire. Not only is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the world outside of man in a constant state of flux and
change, but there is an element within man that is in
constant flux and change also and makes itself felt
practically as an element of expansive desire. What is
unstable in him longs for what is unstable in the outer
world. But he may escape from the element of flux and
change, nay he must aspire to do so, if he wishes to be
released from sorrow. This is to substitute the noble for
the ignoble craving. The permanent or ethical element
in himself towards which he should strive to move is
known to him practically as a power of inhibition or
inner check upon expansive desire. Vital impulse (<i>élan
vital</i>) may be subjected to vital control (<i>frein vital</i>).
Here is the Buddhist equivalent of the “civil war in the
cave” that the romanticist denies. Buddha does not
admit a soul in man in the sense that is often given to
the word, but on this opposition between vital impulse
and vital control as a psychological fact he puts his
supreme emphasis. The man who drifts supinely with the
current of desire is guilty according to Buddha of the
gravest of all vices&mdash;spiritual or moral indolence
(<i>pamāda</i>). He on the contrary who curbs or reins in his
expansive desires is displaying the chief of all the virtues,
spiritual vigilance or strenuousness (<i>appamāda</i>). The
man who is spiritually strenuous has entered upon the
“path.” The end of this path and the goal of being cannot
be formulated in terms of the finite intellect, any more
than the ocean can be put into a cup. But progress on
the path may be known by its fruits&mdash;negatively by the
extinction of the expansive desires (the literal meaning
of Nirvâna), positively by an increase in peace, poise,
centrality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>A man’s rank in the scale of being is, then, according
to the Buddhist determined by the quality of his desires;
and it is within his power to determine whether he shall
let them run wild or else control them to some worthy end.
We hear of the fatalistic East, but no doctrine was ever
less fatalistic than that of Buddha. No one ever put so
squarely upon the individual what the individual is ever
seeking to evade&mdash;the burden of moral responsibility.
“Self is the lord of self. Who else can be the lord? … You
yourself must make the effort. The Buddhas are only
teachers.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But does not all this emphasis on self, one
may ask, tend to hardness and indifference towards
others, towards the undermining of that compassion to
which the romantic moralist is ready to sacrifice all the
other virtues? Buddha may be allowed to speak for
himself: “Even as a mother cherishes her child, her only
child, so let a man cultivate a boundless love towards
all beings.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Buddha thus seems to fulfil Pascal’s requirement
for a great man: he unites in himself opposite
virtues and occupies all the space between them.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to make plain that the infinite
indeterminate desire of the romanticist and the Buddhist
repression of desire are the most different things conceivable.
Chateaubriand it has been said was an “invincibly
restless soul,” a soul of desire (<i>une âme de désir</i>), but
these phrases are scarcely more applicable to him than to
many other great romanticists. They are fitly symbolized
by the figures that pace to and fro in the Hall of Eblis
and whose hearts are seen through their transparent
bosoms to be lapped in the flames of unquenchable longing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
The romanticist indeed bases, as I have said, on the
very intensity of his longing his claims to be an idealist
and even a mystic. William Blake, for example, has been
proclaimed a true mystic. The same term has also been
applied to Buddha. Without pretending to have fathomed
completely so unfathomable a being as Buddha or
even the far less unfathomable William Blake, one may
nevertheless assert with confidence that Buddha and
Blake stand for utterly incompatible views of life. If
Blake is a mystic then Buddha must be something else.
To be assured on this point one needs only to compare
the “Marriage of Heaven and Hell” with the “Dhammapada,”
an anthology of some of the most authentic and
authoritative material in early Buddhism. “He who
desires but acts not, breeds pestilence. … The road of
excess leads to the palace of wisdom,” says Blake. “Even
in heavenly pleasures he finds no satisfaction; the disciple
who is fully awakened delights only in the destruction
of all desires. … Good is restraint in all things,”
says Buddha. Buddha would evidently have dismissed
Blake as a madman, whereas Blake would have looked
on Buddhism as the ultimate abomination. My own conviction
is that Buddha was a genuine sage well worthy
of the homage rendered him by multitudes of men for
more than twenty-four centuries, whereas Blake was
only a romantic æsthete who was moving in his imaginative
activity towards madness and seems at the end
actually to have reached the goal.</p>

<p>I have been going thus far afield to ancient India and
to Buddha, not that I might, like a recent student of
Buddhism, enjoy “the strangeness of the intellectual
landscape,” but on the contrary that I might suggest that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
there is a centre of normal human experience and that
Buddhism, at least in its ethical aspects, is nearer to this
centre than æsthetic romanticism. Buddha might perhaps
marvel with more reason at our strangeness than we at
his. Buddha’s assertion of man’s innate moral laziness in
particular accords more closely with what most of us
have experienced than Rousseau’s assertion of man’s
natural goodness. This conception of the innate laziness
of man seems to me indeed so central that I am going to
put it at the basis of the point of view I am myself seeking
to develop, though this point of view is not primarily
Buddhistic. This conception has the advantage of being
positive rather than dogmatic. It works out in practice
very much like the original sin of the Christian theologian.
The advantage of starting with indolence rather than
sin is that many men will admit that they are morally
indolent who will not admit that they are sinful. For
theological implications still cluster thickly about the word
sin, and these persons are still engaged more or less consciously
in the great naturalistic revolt against theology.</p>

<p>The spiritual positivist then will start from a fact of
immediate perception&mdash;from the presence namely in
the breast of the individual of a principle of vital control
(<i>frein vital</i>), and he will measure his spiritual strenuousness
or spiritual sloth by the degree to which he exercises
or fails to exercise this power. In accordance with the
keenness of a man’s perception of a specially human order
that is known practically as a curb upon his ordinary self,
he may be said to possess insight. The important thing is
that the insight should not be sophisticated, that a man
should not fall away from it into some phantasmagoria of
the intellect or emotions. A man sometimes builds up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
whole system of metaphysics as a sort of screen between
himself and his obligations either to himself or others.
Mrs. Barbauld suspected that Coleridge’s philosophy
was only a mask for indolence. Carlyle’s phrase for Coleridge
was even harsher: “putrescent indolence,” a phrase
that might be applied with more justice perhaps to
Rousseau. One may learn from Rousseau the art of sinking
to the region of instinct that is below the rational level
instead of struggling forward to the region of insight that
is above it, and at the same time passing for a sublime
enthusiast; the art of looking backwards and downwards,
and at the same time enjoying the honor that belongs
only to those who look forwards and up. We need not
wonder at the warm welcome that this new art received.
I have said that that man has always been accounted a
benefactor who has substituted for the reality of spiritual
discipline some ingenious art of going through the motions
and that the decorum of the neo-classical period
had largely sunk to this level. Even in the most decorous
of modern ages, that of Louis XIV, it was very common,
as every student of the period knows, for men to set up as
personages in the grand manner and at the same time
behind the façade of conventional dignity to let their
appetites run riot. It would have been perfectly legitimate
at the end of the eighteenth century to attack in
the name of true decorum a decorum that had become
the “varnish of vice” and “mask of hypocrisy.” What
Rousseau actually opposed to pseudo-decorum was perhaps
the most alluring form of sham spirituality that
the world has ever seen&mdash;a method not merely of masking
but of glorifying one’s spiritual indolence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> “You
wish to have the pleasures of vice and the honor of virtue,”
wrote Julie to Saint-Preux in a moment of unusual
candor. The Rousseauist may indulge in the extreme of
psychic unrestraint and at the same time pose as a perfect
idealist or even, if one is a Chateaubriand, as a champion
of religion. Chateaubriand’s life according to Lemaître
was a “magnificent series of attitudes.”</p>

<p>I do not mean to assert that the Rousseauist is always
guilty of the pose and theatricality of which there is more
than a suggestion in Chateaubriand. There is, however,
much in the Rousseauistic view of life that militates
against a complete moral honesty. “Of all the men I have
known,” says Rousseau, “he whose character derives
most completely from his temperament alone is Jean-Jacques.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The ugly things that have a way of happening
when impulse is thus left uncontrolled do not, as we
have seen, disturb the beautiful soul in his complacency.
He can always point an accusing finger at something or
somebody else. The faith in one’s natural goodness is a
constant encouragement to evade moral responsibility.
To accept responsibility is to follow the line of maximum
effort, whereas man’s secret desire is to follow, if not the
line of least, at all events the line of lesser resistance. The
endless twisting and dodging and proneness to look for
scapegoats that results is surely the least reputable aspect
of human nature. Rousseau writes to Madame de Francueil
(20 April, 1751) that it was her class, the class of the
rich, that was responsible for his having had to abandon
his children. With responsibility thus shifted from one’s
self to the rich, the next step is inevitable, namely to
start a crusade against the members of a class which,
without any warrant from “Nature,” oppresses its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
brothers, the members of other classes, and forces them
into transgression. A man may thus dodge his duties as
a father, and at the same time pose as a paladin of humanity.
Rousseau is very close here to our most recent
agitators. If a working girl falls from chastity, for example,
do not blame her, blame her employer. She would
have remained a model of purity if he had only added a
dollar or two a week to her wage. With the progress of
the new morality every one has become familiar with
the type of the perfect idealist who is ready to pass laws
for the regulation of everybody and everything except
himself, and who knows how to envelop in a mist of radiant
words schemes the true driving power of which is
the desire to confiscate property.</p>

<p>The tendency to make of society the universal scapegoat
is not, one scarcely needs add, to be ascribed entirely
to the romantic moralist. It is only one aspect of the
denial of the human law, of the assumption that because
man is partly subject to the natural law he is entirely
subject to it; and in this dehumanizing of man the rationalist
has been at least as guilty as the emotionalist. If the
Rousseauist hopes to find a substitute for all the restraining
virtues in sympathy, the rationalistic naturalist, who
is as a rule utilitarian with a greater or smaller dash of
pseudo-science, hopes to find a substitute for these same
virtues in some form of machinery. The legislative mill to
which our “uplifters” are so ready to resort, is a familiar
example. If our modern society continues to listen to
those who are seeking to persuade it that it is possible to
find mechanical or emotional equivalents for self-control,
it is likely, as Rousseau said of himself, to show a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> “great
tendency to degenerate.”</p>

<p>The fact on which the moral positivist would rest his
effort to rehabilitate self-control is, as I have said, the
presence in man of a restraining, informing and centralizing
power that is anterior to both intellect and emotion.
Such a power, it must be freely granted, is not present
equally in all persons; in some it seems scarcely to exist
at all. When released from outer control, they are simply
unchained temperaments; whereas in others this superrational
perception seems to be singularly vivid and distinct.
This is the psychological fact that underlies what
the theologian would term the mystery of grace.</p>

<p>Rousseau himself was not quite so temperamental as
might be inferred from what has been said about his
evasion of ethical effort. There were moments when the
dualism of the spirit came home to him, moments when
he perceived that the conscience is not itself an expansive
emotion but rather a judgment and a check upon expansive
emotion. Yet his general readiness to subordinate his
ethical self to his sensibility is indubitable. Hence the
absence in his personality and writing of the note of
masculinity. There is indeed much in his make-up that
reminds one less of a man than of a high-strung impressionable
woman. Woman, most observers would agree, is
more natural in Rousseau’s sense, that is, more temperamental,
than man. One should indeed always temper
these perilous comparisons of the sexes with the remark
of La Fontaine that in this matter he knew a great
many men who were women. Now to be temperamental is
to be extreme, and it is in this sense perhaps that the
female of the species may be said to be “fiercer than the
male.” Rousseau’s failure to find “any intermediary term
between everything and nothing” would seem to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
feminine rather than a masculine trait. Decorum in the
case of women, even more perhaps than in the case of
men, tends to be a mere conformity to what is established
rather than the immediate perception of a law of measure
and proportion that sets bounds to the expansive
desires. “Women believe innocent everything that they
dare,” says Joubert, whom no one will accuse of being
a misogynist. Those who are thus temperamental have
more need than others of outer guidance. “His feminine
nature,” says C. E. Norton of Ruskin, “needed support
such as it never got.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>If women are more temperamental than men it is only
fair to add that they have a greater fineness of temperament.
Women, says Joubert again, are richer in native
virtues, men in acquired virtues. At times when men are
slack in acquiring virtues in the truly ethical sense&mdash;and
some might maintain that the present is such a time&mdash;the
women may be not only men’s equals but their
superiors. Rousseau had this feminine fineness of temperament.
He speaks rightly of his “exquisite faculties.”
He also had no inconsiderable amount of feminine charm.
The numerous members of the French aristocracy whom
he fascinated may be accepted as competent witnesses
on this point. The mingling of sense and spirit that pervades
Rousseau, his pseudo-Platonism as I have called
it elsewhere, is also a feminine rather than a masculine
trait.</p>

<p>There is likewise something feminine in Rousseau’s
preference for illusion. Illusion is the element in which
woman even more than man would seem to live and move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and have her being. It is feminine and also romantic to
prefer to a world of sharp definition a world of magic and
suggestiveness. W. Bagehot (it will be observed that in
discussing this delicate topic I am prone to take refuge
behind authorities) attributes the triumph of an art of
shifting illusion over an art of clear and firm outlines to
the growing influence of women.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Woman’s being is to
that of man, we are told, as is moonlight unto sunlight&mdash;and
the moon is the romantic orb. The whole of German
romance in particular is bathed in moonshine.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The objection of the classicist to the so-called enlightenment
of the eighteenth century is that it did not have
in it sufficient light. The primitivists on the contrary
felt that it had too much light&mdash;that the light needed to
be tempered by darkness. Even the moon is too effulgent
for the author of “Hymns to the Night.” No movement
has ever avowed more openly its partiality for the dim
and the crepuscular. The German romanticists have
been termed “twilight men.” What many of them admire
in woman as in children and plants, is her unconsciousness
and freedom from analysis&mdash;an admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that is also a tribute in its way to the “night side”
of nature.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Discussions of the kind in which I have been indulging
regarding the unlikeness of woman and man are very
dreary unless one puts at least equal emphasis on their
fundamental likeness. Woman, before being woman, is a
human being and so subject to the same law as man. So
far as men and women both take on the yoke of this law,
they move towards a common centre. So far as they throw
it off and live temperamentally, there tends to arise
the most odious of all forms of warfare&mdash;that between
the sexes. The dictates of the human law are only too
likely to yield in the case of both men and women to the
rush of outer impressions and the tumult of the desires
within. This is what La Rochefoucauld means when he
says that “the head is always the dupe of the heart.”
Nevertheless feeling is even more likely to prevail over
judgment in woman than it is in man. To be judicial
indeed to the point of hardness and sternness has always
been held to be unfeminine. It is almost woman’s prerogative
to err on the side of sympathy. But even woman
cannot be allowed to substitute sympathy for true conscience&mdash;that
is for the principle of control. In basing
conduct on feeling Rousseau may be said to have founded
a new sophistry. The ancient sophist at least made man
the measure of all things. By subordinating judgment to
sensibility Rousseau may be said to have made woman
the measure of all things.</p>

<p>The affirmation of a human law must ultimately rest
on the perception of a something that is set above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
flux upon which the flux itself depends&mdash;on what Aristotle
terms an unmoved mover. Otherwise conscience
becomes a part of the very flux and element of change it
is supposed to control. In proportion as he escapes from
outer control man must be conscious of some such unmoved
mover if he is to oppose a definite aim or purpose
to the indefinite expansion of his desires. Having
some such firm centre he may hope to carry through to a
fortunate conclusion the “civil war in the cave.” He may,
as the wise are wont to express it, build himself an island
in the midst of the flood. The romantic moralist, on the
other hand, instead of building himself an island is simply
drifting with the stream. For feeling not only shifts
from man to man, it is continually shifting in the same
man; so that morality becomes a matter of mood, and
romanticism here as elsewhere might be defined as the
despotism of mood. At the time of doing anything, says
Mrs. Shelley, Shelley deemed himself right; and Rousseau
says that in the act of abandoning his own children
he felt “like a member of Plato’s republic.”</p>

<p>The man who makes self-expression and not self-control
his primary endeavor becomes subject to every
influence, “the very slave of circumstance and impulse
borne by every breath.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This is what it means in practice
no longer to keep a firm hand on the rudder of one’s
personality, but to turn one’s self over to “nature.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
partisan of expression becomes the thrall of his impressions
so that the whole Rousseauistic conception may be
termed indifferently impressionistic or expressionistic.
For the beautiful soul in order to express himself has to
indulge his emotions instead of hardening and bracing
them against the shock of circumstance. The very refinement
of sensibility which constitutes in his own eyes his
superiority to the philistine makes him quiver responsive
to every outer influence; he finally becomes subject to
changes in the weather, or in Rousseau’s own phrase, the
“vile plaything of the atmosphere and seasons.”</p>

<p>This rapid shifting of mood in the romanticist, in response
to inner impulse or outer impression, is almost
too familiar to need illustration. Here is an example that
may serve for a thousand from that life-long devotee of
the great god Whim&mdash;Hector Berlioz. When at Florence,
Berlioz relates in his Memoirs, he received a letter from
the mother of Camille, the woman he loved, informing him
of Camille’s marriage to another. “In two minutes my
plans were laid. I must hurry to Paris to kill two guilty
women and one innocent man; for, this act of justice done,
I too must die.” Accordingly he loads his pistols, supplies
himself with a disguise as a lady’s maid, so as to be able
to penetrate into the guilty household, and puts into his
pockets “two little bottles, one of strychnine, the other
of laudanum.” While awaiting the departure of the
diligence he “rages up and down the streets of Florence
like a mad dog.” Later, as the diligence is traversing a
wild mountain road, he suddenly lets out a “‘Ha’! so
hoarse, so savage, so diabolic that the startled driver
bounded aside as if he had indeed a demon for his fellow-traveller.”
But on reaching Nice he is so enchanted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the climate and environment that he not only forgets his
errand, but spends there “the twenty happiest days” of
his life! There are times, one must admit, when it is an
advantage to be temperamental.</p>

<p>In this exaltation of environmental influences one
should note again the coöperation of Rousseauist and
Baconian, of emotional and scientific naturalist. Both
are prone to look upon man as being made by natural
forces and not as making himself. To deal with the substitutes
that Rousseauist and Baconian have proposed
for traditional morality, is in fact to make a study of the
varieties&mdash;and they are numerous&mdash;of naturalistic fatalism.
The upshot of the whole movement is to discredit
moral effort on the part of the individual. Why should
a man believe in the efficacy of this effort, why should
he struggle to acquire character if he is convinced that
he is being moulded like putty by influences beyond his
control&mdash;the influence of climate, for example? Both
science and romanticism have vied with one another in
making of man a mere stop on which Nature may play
what tune she will. The Æolian harp enjoyed an extraordinary
popularity as a romantic symbol. The man of science
for his part is ready to draw up statistical tables
showing what season of the year is most productive of
suicide and what type of weather impels bank-cashiers
most irresistibly to embezzlement. A man on a mountain
top, according to Rousseau, enjoys not only physical
but spiritual elevation, and when he descends to the plain
the altitude of his mind declines with that of his body.
Ruskin’s soul, says C. E. Norton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> “was like an Æolian
harp, its strings quivering musically in serene days under
the touch of the soft air, but as the clouds gathered and
the winds arose, vibrating in the blast with a tension that
might break the sounding board itself.” It is not surprising
Ruskin makes other men as subject to “skyey influences”
as himself. “The mountains of the earth are,” he
says, “its natural cathedrals. True religion can scarcely
be achieved away from them. The curate or hermit of the
field and fen, however simple his life or painful his lodging,
does not often attain the spirit of the hill pastor or
recluse: we may find in him a decent virtue or a contented
ignorance, rarely the <i>prophetic vision or the martyr’s
passion</i>.” The corruptions of Romanism “are traceable
for the most part to lowland prelacy.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Is then the Rousseauist totally unable to regulate his
impressions? It is plain that he cannot control them from
within because the whole idea of a vital control of this
kind is, as we have seen, foreign to the psychology of the
beautiful soul. Yet it is, according to Rousseau, possible
to base morality on the senses&mdash;on outer perception that
is&mdash;and at the same time get the equivalent of a free-will
based on inner perception. He was so much interested
in this subject that he had planned to devote to it a
whole treatise to be entitled “Sensitive morality or the
materialism of the sage.” A man cannot resist an outer
impression but he may at least get out of its way and put
himself in the way of another impression that will impel
him to the desired course of conduct. “The soul may then
be put or maintained in the state most favorable to
virtue.” “Climates, seasons, sounds, colors, darkness,
light, the elements, food, noise, silence, movement, rest,
everything, acts on our physical frame.” By a proper
adjustment of all these outer elements we may govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
in their origins the feelings by which we allow ourselves
to be dominated.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Rousseau’s ideas about sensitive morality are at once
highly chimerical and highly significant. Here as elsewhere
one may say with Amiel that nothing of Rousseau
has been lost. His point of view has an inner kinship with
that of the man of science who asserts that man is necessarily
the product of natural forces, but that one may
at least modify the natural forces. For example, moral
effort on the part of the individual cannot overcome
heredity. It is possible, however, by schemes of eugenics
to regulate heredity. The uneasy burden of moral responsibility
is thus lifted from the individual, and the
moralist in the old-fashioned sense is invited to abdicate
in favor of the biologist. It would be easy enough to
trace similar assumptions in the various forms of socialism
and other “isms” almost innumerable of the present hour.</p>

<p>Perhaps the problem to which I have already alluded
may as well be faced here. How does it happen that
Rousseau who attacked both science and literature as
the chief sources of human degeneracy should be an arch-æsthete,
the authentic ancestor of the school of art for
art’s sake and at the same time by his sensitive (or æsthetic)
morality play into the hands of the scientific
determinist? If one is to enter deeply into the modern
movement one needs to consider both wherein scientific
and emotional naturalists clash and wherein they agree.
The two types of naturalists agree in their virtual denial
of a superrational realm. They clash above all in their
attitude towards what is on the rational level. The scientific
naturalist is assiduously analytical. Rousseau, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
other hand, or rather one whole side of Rousseau, is
hostile to analysis. The arts and sciences are attacked
because they are the product of reflection. “The man
who reflects is a depraved animal,” because he has fallen
away from the primitive spontaneous unity of his being.
Rousseau is the first of the great anti-intellectualists.
By assailing both rationalism and pseudo-classic decorum
in the name of instinct and emotion he appealed to men’s
longing to get away from the secondary and the derivative
to the immediate. True decorum satisfies the craving
for immediacy because it contains within itself an element
of superrational perception. The “reason” of a Plato or
an Aristotle also satisfies the craving for immediacy because
it likewise contains within itself an element of
superrational perception. A reason or a decorum of this
kind ministers to another deep need of human nature&mdash;the
need to lose itself in a larger whole. Once eliminate
the superrational perception and reason sinks to the level
of rationalism, consciousness becomes mere self-consciousness.
It is difficult, as St. Evremond said, for man
to remain in the long run in this doubtful middle state.
Having lost the unity of insight, he will long for the unity
of instinct. Hence the paradox that this most self-conscious
of all movements is filled with the praise of the
unconscious. It abounds in persons who, like Walt Whitman,
would turn and live with the animals, or who, like
Novalis, would fain strike root into the earth with the
plant. Animals<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and plants are not engaged in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
moral struggle, they are not inwardly divided against
themselves.</p>

<p>Here is the source of the opposition between the abstract
and analytical head, deadly to the sense of unity,
and the warm immediate heart that unifies life with the
aid of the imagination&mdash;an opposition that assumes so
many forms from Rousseau to Bergson. The Rousseauist
always betrays himself by arraigning in some form or
other, “the false secondary power by which we multiply
distinctions.” One should indeed remember that there
were obscurantists before Rousseau. Pascal also arrays
the heart against the head; but his heart is at the farthest
remove from that of Rousseau; it stands for a superrational
perception. Christians like Pascal may indulge with
comparative impunity in a certain amount of obscurantism.
For they have submitted to a tradition that supplies
them with distinctions between good and evil and at the
same time controls their imagination. But for the individualist
who has broken with tradition to deny his head
in the name of his heart is a deadly peril. He above all
persons should insist that the power by which we multiply
distinctions, though secondary, is not false&mdash;that
the intellect, of however little avail in itself, is invaluable
when working in coöperation with the imagination in the
service of either inner or outer perception. It is only
through the analytical head and its keen discriminations
that the individualist can determine whether the unity
and infinitude towards which his imagination is reaching
(and it is only through the imagination that one can have
the sense of unity and infinitude) is real or merely chimerical.
Need I add that in making these distinctions
between imagination, intellect, feeling, etc., I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
attempting to divide man up into more or less watertight
compartments, into hard and fast “faculties,” but
merely to express, however imperfectly, certain obscure
and profound facts of experience?</p>

<p>The varieties of what one may term the rationalistic
error, of the endeavor of the intellect to emancipate itself
from perception and set up as an independent power,
are numerous. The variety that was perhaps formerly
most familiar was that of the theologian who sought to
formulate intellectually what must ever transcend formulation.
The forms of the rationalistic error that concern
our present subject can be traced back for the
most part to Descartes, the father of modern philosophy,
and are indeed implicit in his famous identification of
thought and being (<i>Je pense, donc je suis</i>). The dogmatic
and arrogant rationalism that denies both what is above
and what is below itself, both the realm of awe and the
realm of wonder, which prevailed among the Cartesians
of the Enlightenment, combined, as I have said, with
pseudo-classic decorum to produce that sense of confinement
and smugness against which the original genius
protested. Man will always crave a view of life to which
perception lends immediacy and the imagination infinitude.
A view of life like that of the eighteenth century
that reduces unduly the rôle of both imagination and
perception will always seem to him unvital and mechanical.
“The Bounded,” says Blake, “is loathed by its possessor.
The same dull round even of a Universe would
soon become a Mill with complicated wheels.”</p>

<p>The mechanizing of life against which the romanticist
protested may as I said be largely associated with the
influence of Descartes. It is not however the whole truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
about Descartes to say that he forgot the purely instrumental
rôle of the intellect and encouraged it to set up
as an independent power. As a matter of fact he also
used the intellect as an instrument in the service of outer
perception. Taking as his point of departure the precise
observations that science was accumulating, he sought
to formulate mathematically the natural law. Now the
more one reduces nature to a problem of space and
movement, the more one is enabled to measure nature;
and the method of exact measurement may be justified,
if not on metaphysical, at least on practical grounds.
It helps one, if not to understand natural forces, at
least to control them. It thereby increases man’s power
and ministers to utility. In a word, the intellect when
thus pressed into the service of outer perception makes
for material efficiency. In a sense science becomes scientific
only in proportion as it neglects the qualitative
differences between phenomena, e.g. between light
and sound, and treats them solely from the point of view
of quantity. But the penalty that science pays for this
quantitative method is a heavy one. The farther it gets
away from the warm immediacy of perception the less
real it becomes; for that only is real to a man that he
immediately perceives. Perfectly pure science tends to
become a series of abstract mathematical formulæ without
any real content. By his resort to such a method, the
man of science is in constant danger of becoming a mere
rationalist. At bottom he is ignorant of the reality that
lies behind natural phenomena; he must even be ignorant
of it, for it lays hold upon the infinite, and so must elude
a finite being like man. But the desire to conceal his own
ignorance from himself and others, the secret push for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
power and prestige that lies deep down in the breast of
the man of science as in that of every other man, impels
him to attach an independent value to the operations of
the intellect that have only an instrumental value in the
service of outer perception and to conceive that he has
locked up physical nature in his formulæ. The man of
science thus falls victim to a special form of metaphysical
illusion. The gravity of the error of the scientific intellectualist
is multiplied tenfold when he conceives that his
formulæ cover not merely the natural law but the human
law as well, when he strives, like Taine, to convert man
himself into a “walking theorem,” a “living geometry.”
This denial of every form of spontaneity was rightly felt
by the romanticists to be intolerable.</p>

<p>Goethe contrasts the smug satisfaction of Wagner in
his dead formulæ that give only what is external and
secondary, with Faust’s fierce craving for immediacy and
therefore his impatience with an analysis that gives only
the dry bones from which the vital breath has departed.
Wagner is a philistine because he is not tormented by the
thirst for the infinite. Faust, on the other hand, reaches
out beyond the mere intellect towards the spirit that is
behind the shows of nature, but this spirit appears to
him and reduces him to despair by declaring that he is
trying to grasp something that is not only infinite but
alien to him. Instead of turning from this alien spirit
to the spirit that is relevant to man, a spirit that sets
bounds to every inordinate craving, including the inordinate
craving for knowledge (<i>libido sciendi</i>), Faust gives
himself to the devil in what was, in the time of the
youthful Goethe, the newest fashion: he becomes a
Rousseauist. Instead of striking into the ascending path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of insight, he descends to the level of impulse. Seen from
this level the power by which we multiply distinctions
seems to him, as it was to seem later to Wordsworth, not
merely secondary but false, and so definition yields to
indiscriminate feeling (<i>Gefühl ist alles</i>). In general the
Rousseauistic reply to the Cartesian attempt to identify
thought and being is the identification of being with emotion
(<i>je sens donc je suis</i>).</p>

<p>The Mephistopheles of Goethe has often been taken as
a symbol of the iconoclastic and Voltairian side of the
eighteenth century. The rationalists assailed the traditional
forms that imply a superrational realm as mere
“prejudice,” and, failing to find in insight a substitute
for these discarded forms, they succumbed in turn to the
emotionalists. A “reason” that is not grounded in insight
will always seem to men intolerably cold and negative and
will prove unable to withstand the assault of the primary
passions. The reason of a Plato or an Aristotle
is on a different footing altogether because, as I have
said, it includes an element of inner perception. One may
note here that the difficulties of the present subject arise
in no small degree from the ambiguities that cluster about
the word reason. It may not only mean the imaginative
insight<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> of a Plato and the abstract reasoning of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Descartes but is often employed by the classicist himself
as a synonym of good sense. Good sense may be defined
as a correct perception of the ordinary facts of life and
of their relation to one another. It may be of very many
grades, corresponding to the infinite diversity of the facts
to be perceived. A man may evidently have good sense
in dealing with one order of facts, and quite lack it in dealing
with some different order of facts. As the result of long
observation and experience of a multitude of minute relationships,
of the facts that ordinarily follow one another
or coexist in some particular field, a man’s knowledge of
this field becomes at last, as it were, automatic and unconscious.
A sea captain for example acquires at last an
intuitive knowledge of the weather, the broker, an intuitive
knowledge of stocks. The good sense or practical
judgment of the sea captain in his particular calling and
of the broker in his is likely to be greater than that of less
experienced persons. One cannot, however, assert that a
man’s good sense is always in strict ratio to his experience.
Some persons seem to have an innate gift for seeing
things as they are, others a gift equally innate for seeing
things as they are not.</p>

<p>Again the field in which one displays one’s good sense
or practical judgment may fall primarily under either the
human law or the natural law, may belong in Aristotelian
phrase to the domain either of the probable or of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
necessary. To take a homely illustration, a man is free
to choose the temperature of his bath, but only within
the limits of natural necessity&mdash;in this case the temperature
at which water freezes and that at which water
boils. He will show his practical judgment by choosing
water that is neither too hot nor too cold and this so far
as he is concerned will be the golden mean. Here as elsewhere
the golden mean is nothing mechanical, but may
vary not only from individual to individual but in the
same individual according to his age, the state of his
health, etc. In determining what conforms to the golden
mean or law of measure there must always be a mediation
between the particular instance and the general principle,
and it is here that intuition is indispensable. But even
so there is a centre of normal human experience, and the
person who is too far removed from it ceases to be probable.
Aged persons may exist who find bathing in ice-water
beneficial, but they are not representative. Now
creative art, in distinct ratio to its dignity, deals not with
what may happen in isolated cases but with what happens
according to probability or necessity. It is this preoccupation
with the universal that as Aristotle says
makes poetry a more serious and philosophical thing than
history. There enters indeed into true art an element of
vital novelty and surprise. But the more cultivated the
audience to which the creator addresses himself the more
will it insist that the surprise be not won at the expense
of motivation. It will demand that characters and incidents
be not freakish, not too remote from the facts that
normally follow one another or coexist, whether in nature
or human nature. One needs, in short, to deal with
both art and life from some ethical centre. The centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
with reference to which one has good sense may be only
the ethos of one’s time and country, but if one’s good
sense has, as in the case of the great poets, the support of
the imagination, it may pass beyond to something more
abiding. “Of Pope’s intellectual character,” says Dr.
Johnson, “the constituent and fundamental principle was
good sense, a prompt and intuitive perception of consonance
and propriety. He saw immediately of his own
conceptions what was to be chosen, and what to be rejected.”
One may grant all this and at the same time feel
the difference between the “reason” of a Pope and the
reason of a Sophocles.</p>

<p>Good sense of the kind Dr. Johnson describes and decorum
are not strictly speaking synonymous. To be
decorous not only must one have a correct perception of
what to do, but one must actually be able to do it; and
this often requires a long and difficult training. We have
seen that Rousseau’s spite against eighteenth-century
Paris was largely due to the fact that he had not acquired
young enough the habits that would have made
it possible for him to conform to its convention. “I
affected,” says Rousseau with singular candor, “to despise
the politeness I did not know how to practice.”
As a matter of fact he had never adjusted himself to the
decorum and good sense of any community. His attitude
towards life was fundamentally Bohemian. But a person
who was sensible and decorous according to the standards
of some other country might have emphasized the differences
between his good sense and decorum and the good
sense and decorum of eighteenth-century Paris. The opponents
of the traditional order in the eighteenth century
were fond of introducing some Persian or Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to whom this order seemed no true order at all but only
“prejudice” or “abuse.” The conclusion would seem to be
that because the good sense and decorum of one time and
country do not coincide exactly with those of another
time and country, therefore good sense and decorum
themselves have in them no universal element, and are
entirely implicated in the shifting circumstances of time
and place. But behind the ethos of any particular country,
that of Greece, for instance, there are, as Antigone
perceived, the “unwritten laws of heaven,” and something
of this permanent order is sure to shine through
even the most imperfect convention. Though no convention
is final, though man and all he establishes are
subject to the law of change, it is therefore an infinitely
delicate and perilous task to break with convention. One
can make this break only in favor of insight; which is
much as if one should say that the only thing that may
safely be opposed to common sense is a commoner sense, or
if one prefers, a common sense that is becoming more and
more imaginative. Even so, the wiser the man, one may
surmise, the less likely he will be to indulge in a violent
and theatrical rupture with his age, after the fashion of
Rousseau. He will like Socrates remember the counsel
of the Delphian oracle to follow the “usage of the city,”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
and while striving to gain a firmer hold upon the human
law and to impose a more strenuous discipline upon his
ordinary self, he will so far as possible conform to what
he finds established. A student of the past cannot help
being struck by the fact that men are found scattered
through different times and countries and living under
very different conventions who are nevertheless in virtue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of their insight plainly moving towards a common
centre. So much so that the best books of the world seem
to have been written, as Emerson puts it, by one all-wise,
all-seeing gentleman. A curious circumstance is that the
writers who are most universal in virtue of their imaginative
reason or inspired good sense, are likewise as a rule
the writers who realized most intensely the life of their
own age. No other Spanish writer, for example, has so
much human appeal as Cervantes, and at the same time
no other brings us so close to the heart of sixteenth-century
Spain. In the writings attributed to Confucius
one encounters, mixed up with much that is almost inconceivably
remote from us, maxims that have not lost
their validity to-day; maxims that are sure to be reaffirmed
wherever and whenever men attain to the level of
humanistic insight. In the oldest Buddhist documents
again one finds along with a great deal that is very expressive
of ancient India, and thus quite foreign to our
idiosyncrasy, a good sense which is even more imaginative
and inspired, and therefore more universal, than that of
Confucius, and which is manifested, moreover, on the
religious rather than on the humanistic level. We are
dealing here with indubitable facts, and should plant
ourselves firmly upon them as against those who would
exaggerate either the constant or the variable elements
in human nature.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show the ambiguities involved
in the word reason. Reason may mean the abstract and
geometrical reason of a Descartes, it may mean simply
good sense, which may itself exist in very many grades
ranging from an intuitive mastery of some particular
field to the intuitive mastery of the ethos of a whole age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
like the reason of a Pope. Finally reason may be imaginative
and be thereby enabled to go beyond the convention
of a particular time and country, and lay hold in varying
degrees on “the unwritten laws of heaven.” I have
already traced in some measure the process by which
reason in the eighteenth century had come to mean
abstract and geometrical (or as one may say Cartesian)
reason or else unimaginative good sense. Cartesian
reason was on the one hand being pressed into the service
of science and its special order of perceptions; on the
other hand it was being used frequently in coöperation
with an unimaginative good sense to attack the traditional
forms that imply a realm of insight which is above
both abstract reason and ordinary good sense. Men were
emboldened to use reason in this way because they were
flushed not only by the increasing mastery of man over
nature through science, but by the positive and anti-traditional
method through which this mastery had been
won. Both those who proclaimed and those who denied
a superrational realm were at least agreed in holding that
the faith in any such realm was inseparable from certain
traditional forms. Pascal, for example, held not only that
insight in religion is annexed to the acceptance of certain
dogmas&mdash;and this offended the new critical spirit&mdash;but
furthermore that insight could exist even in the orthodox
only by a special divine gift or grace, and this offended
man’s reviving confidence in himself. People were ready
to applaud when a Voltaire declared it was time to “take
the side of human nature against this sublime misanthropist.”
The insight into the law of decorum on which
classicism must ultimately rest was in much the same
way held to be inseparable from the Græco-Roman tradition;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and so the nature of classical insight as a thing
apart from any tradition tended to be obscured in the
endless bickerings of ancients and moderns. The classical
traditionalists, however, were less prone than the Christian
traditionalists (Jansenists, Jesuits and Protestants)
to weaken their cause still further by wrangling among
themselves.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as both Christians and humanists failed to
plant themselves on the fact of insight, the insight came
more and more to be rejected along with the special forms
from which it was deemed to be inseparable. As a result
of this rejection “reason” was left to cope unaided with
man’s impulses and expansive desires. Now Pascal saw
rightly that the balance of power in such a conflict between
reason and impulse was held by the imagination,
and that if reason lacked the support of insight the imagination
would side with the expansive desires and reason
would succumb. Moreover the superrational insight, or
“heart” as Pascal calls it, that can alone keep man from
being thus overwhelmed, comes, as he holds, not through
reason but through grace and is at times actually opposed
to reason. (“The heart,” he says, “has reasons of which
the reason knows nothing.”) Instead of protesting against
the asceticism of this view as the true positivist would
do, instead of insisting that reason and imagination may
pull together harmoniously in the service of insight, the
romantic moralist opposed to the superrational “heart”
of the austere Christian a subrational “heart,” and this
involved an attempt to base morality on the very element
in human nature it is designed to restrain. The positivist
will plant himself first of all on the fact of insight and will
define it as the immediate perception of a something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
anterior to both thought and feeling, that is known practically
as a power of control over both. The beautiful
soul, as we have seen, has no place for any such power in
his scheme of things, but hopes to satisfy all ethical elements
simply by letting himself go. Rousseau (following
Shaftesbury and Hutcheson) transforms conscience itself
from an inner check into an expansive emotion. While
thus corrupting conscience in its very essence he does
not deny conscience. On the contrary he grows positively
rhapsodic over conscience and other similar words.
“Rousseau took wisdom from men’s souls,” says Joubert,
“by talking to them of virtue.” In short, Rousseau displays
the usual dexterity of the sophist in juggling with
ill-defined general terms. If one calls for sharp definition
one is at once dismissed as a mere rationalist who is retreating
into a false secondary power from a warm immediacy.
The traditional distinctions regarding good and
bad were thus discarded at the same time that discredit
was cast on the keen analysis with which it would have
been possible to build up new distinctions&mdash;all in favor
of an indiscriminate emotionalism. This discomfiture of
both tradition and analysis in the field of the human law
would not have been so easy if at the same time man’s
active attention and effort had not been concentrated
more and more on the field of the natural law. In that
field imagination and the analytical intellect were actually
pulling together in the service of perception with the
result that man was constantly gaining in power and
utility. Emotional romanticists and scientific utilitarians
have thus, in spite of their surface clashes, cooperated
during the past century in the dehumanizing of man.</p>

<p>It is not enough to say of the representatives of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
sides of this great naturalistic movement that they eliminate
the veto power from human nature while continuing
to use the old words, like virtue and conscience, that imply
a veto power. We have seen that they actually attack the
veto power as synonymous with evil. The devil is conceived
as the spirit that always says no. A purely affirmative
morality is almost necessarily an emotional morality.
If there is no region of insight above the reason which is
felt by the natural man as an element of vital control,
and if cold reason, reason unsupported by insight, never
has done anything illustrious, as Rousseau truly says, it
follows that the only way to put driving power behind
reason is to turn virtue into a passion,&mdash;a passion that
differs from other passions merely in its greater imperiousness.
For the beautiful soul virtue, as we have seen
in the case of Robespierre, is not only a tender, imperious
and voluptuous passion but even an intoxication. “I was,
if not virtuous,” says Rousseau, “at least intoxicated
with virtue.” In its extreme manifestations romantic
morality is indeed only one aspect, and surely the most
singular aspect, of the romantic cult of intoxication. No
student of romanticism can fail to be struck by its
pursuit of delirium, vertigo and intoxication for their
own sake. It is important to see how all these things are
closely related to one another and how they all derive
from the attempt to put life on an emotional basis. To
rest conscience, for example, on emotion is to rest it on
what is always changing, not only from man to man but
from moment to moment in the same man. “If,” as
Shelley says, “nought is, but that it feels itself to be,” it
will feel itself to be very different things at different times.
No part of man is exempt from the region of flux and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
change. There is, as James himself points out, a kinship
between such a philosophy of pure motion and vertigo.
Faust after all is only consistent when having identified
the spirit that says no, which is the true voice of conscience,
with the devil, he proceeds to dedicate himself
to vertigo (<i>dem Taumel weih’ ich mich</i>). Rousseau also,
as readers of the “Confessions” will remember, deliberately
courted giddiness by gazing down on a waterfall from the
brink of a precipice (making sure first that the railing on
which he leaned was good and strong). This naturalistic
dizziness became epidemic among the Greeks at the critical
moment of their break with traditional standards.
“Whirl is King,” cried Aristophanes, “having driven out
Zeus.” The modern sophist is even more a votary of the
god Whirl than the Greek, for he has added to the mobility
of an intellect that has no support in either tradition or
insight the mobility of feeling. Many Rousseauists were,
like Hazlitt, attracted to the French Revolution by its
“grand whirling movements.”</p>

<p>Even more significant than the cult of vertigo is the
closely allied cult of intoxication. “Man being reasonable,”
says Byron, with true Rousseauistic logic, “must
therefore get drunk. The best of life is but intoxication.”
The subrational and impulsive self of the man who has
got drunk is not only released from the surveillance of
reason in any sense of the word, but his imagination is
at the same tune set free from the limitations of the real.
If many Rousseauists have been rightly accused of being
“lovers of delirium,” that is because in delirium the
fancy is especially free to wander wild in its own empire
of chimeras. To compose a poem, as Coleridge is supposed
to have composed “Kubla Khan,” in an opium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
dream without any participation of his rational self is a
triumph of romantic art. “I should have taken more
opium when I wrote it,” said Friedrich Schlegel in explanation
of the failure of his play “Alarcos.” What more
specially concerns our present topic is the carrying over of
this subrational “enthusiasm” into the field of ethical
values, and this calls for certain careful distinctions.
Genuine religion&mdash;whether genuine Christianity or
genuine Buddhism&mdash;is plainly unfriendly in the highest
degree to every form of intoxication. Buddhism, for
example, not only prohibits the actual use of intoxicants
but it pursues implacably all the subtler intoxications of
the spirit. The attitude of the humanist towards intoxication
is somewhat more complex. He recognizes how
deep in man’s nature is the craving for some blunting of
the sharp edge of his consciousness and at least a partial
escape from reason and reality; and so he often makes a
place on the recreative side of life for such moments of
escape even if attained with the aid of wine. <i>Dulce est
desipere in loco.</i> Pindar, who displays so often in his verse
the high seriousness of the ethical imagination, is simply
observing the decorum of the occasion when he celebrates
in a song for the end of a feast “the time when the wearisome
cares of men have vanished from their reasons and
on a wide sea of golden wealth we are all alike voyaging
to some visionary shore. He that is penniless is then rich,
and even they that are wealthy find their hearts expanding,
when they are smitten by the arrows of the vine.”
The true Greek, one scarcely needs add, put his final emphasis,
as befitted a child of Apollo, not on intoxication
but on the law of measure and sobriety&mdash;on preserving
the integrity of his mind, to render literally the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
word for the virtue that he perhaps prized the most.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> One
must indeed remember that alongside the Apollonian
element in Greek life is the orgiastic or Dyonisiac element.
But when Euripides sides imaginatively with the
frenzy of Dionysus, as he does in his “Bacchae,” though
ostensibly preaching moderation, we may affirm that he
is falling away from what is best in the spirit of Hellas and
revealing a kinship with the votaries of the god Whirl.
The cult of intoxication has as a matter of fact appeared
in all times and places where men have sought to get the
equivalent of religious vision and the sense of oneness that
it brings without rising above the naturalistic level. True
religious vision is a process of concentration, the result of
the imposition of the veto power upon the expansive
desires of the ordinary self. The various naturalistic
simulations of this vision are, on the contrary, expansive,
the result of a more or less complete escape from the veto
power, whether won with the aid of intoxicants or not.
The emotional romanticists from Rousseau down have
left no doubt as to the type of vision they represented.
Rousseau dilates with a sort of fellow feeling on the deep
potations that went on in the taverns of patriarchal
Geneva.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Renan looks with disfavor on those who are
trying to diminish drunkenness among the common
people. He merely asks that this drunkenness “be
gentle, amiable, accompanied by moral sentiments.”
Perhaps this side of the movement is best summed up
in the following passage of William James:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> “The sway
of alcohol over mankind is unquestionably due to its
power to stimulate the mystical faculties of human nature,
usually crushed to earth by the cold facts and dry
criticisms of the sober hour. Sobriety diminishes, discriminates
and says no; drunkenness expands, unites, and
says yes. It is, in fact, the great exciter of the <i>Yes</i> function
in man. It brings its votary from the chill periphery
of things to the radiant core. It makes him for the moment
one with truth.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>The American distiller who named one of his brands
“Golden Dream Whiskey” was evidently too modest.
If an adept in the new psychology he might have set up
as a pure idealist, as the opener up of an especially radiant
pathway to the “truth.”</p>

<p>The primitivist then attacks sober discrimination as
an obstacle both to warm immediacy of feeling and to
unity. He tends to associate the emotional unity that
he gains through intoxication with the unity of instinct
which he so admires in the world of the subrational. “The
romantic character,” says Ricarda Huch, “is more exposed
to waste itself in debaucheries than any other; for
only in intoxication, whether of love or wine, when the
one half of its being, consciousness, is lulled to sleep, can
it enjoy the bliss for which it envies every beast&mdash;the
bliss of feeling itself one.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The desires of the animal,
however, work within certain definite limits. They are
not, like those of the primitivist, inordinate, the explanation
being that they are less stimulated than the desires
of the primitivist by the imagination. Even if he gets rid
of intellect and moral effort, the primitivist cannot attain
the unity of instinct because he remains too imaginative;
at the same time he proclaims and proclaims rightly that
the imagination is the great unifying power&mdash;the power
that can alone save us from viewing things in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> “disconnection
dead and spiritless.” We should attend carefully
at this point for we are coming to the heart of the great
romantic sophism. The Rousseauist does not attain to
the unity of the man whose impulses and desires are controlled
and disciplined to some ethical centre. He does not,
in spite of all his praise of the unconscious and of the
“sublime animals,” attain to the unity of instinct. In
what sense then may he be said to attain unity? The
obvious reply is that he attains unity only in dreamland.
For the nature to which he would return, one cannot
repeat too often, is nothing real, but a mere nostalgic
straining of the imagination away from the real. It is
only in dreamland that one can rest unity on the expansive
forces of personality that actually divide not only
one individual from another but the same individual
from himself. It is only in dreamland that, in the absence
of both inner and outer control, “all things” will “flow
to all, as rivers to the sea.” Such a unity will be no more
than a dream unity, even though one term it the ideal
and sophisticate in its favor all the traditional terms of
religion and morality. A question that forces itself at
every stage upon the student of this movement is: <i>What
is the value of unity without reality?</i> For two things are
equally indubitable: first, that romanticism on the philosophical
side, is a protest in the name of unity against the
disintegrating analysis of the eighteenth-century rationalist;
second, that what the primitivist wants in exchange
for analysis is not reality but illusion. Rousseau who inclines
like other æsthetes to identify the true with the
beautiful was, we are told, wont to exclaim: “There is
nothing beautiful save that which is not”; a saying to
be matched with that of “La Nouvelle Héloïse”:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> “The
land of chimeras is alone worthy of habitation.” Similar
utterances might be multiplied from French, English, and
German romanticists.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> To be sure, the word “reality” is
perhaps the most slippery of all general terms. Certain
recent votaries of the god Whirl, notably Bergson, have
promised us that if we surrender to the flux we shall have
a “vision” not only of unity but also of reality; and so
they have transferred to the cult of their divinity all
the traditional language of religion.</p>

<p>We do not, however, need for the present to enter into
a discussion as to the nature of reality, but simply to stick
to strict psychological observation. From this point of
view it is not hard to see that the primitivist makes his
primary appeal not to man’s need for unity and reality
but to a very different need. Byron has told us what this
need is in his tale (“The Island”) of a ship’s crew that
overpowered its officers and then set sail for Otaheite;
what impelled these Arcadian mutineers was not the
desire for a genuine return to aboriginal life with its rigid
conventions, but</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The wish&mdash;which ages have not yet subdued</div>

<p>Now to have no master save one’s mood is to be wholly

sympathy and brotherly love. It remains to consider

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">ROMANTIC MORALITY: THE REAL</span></h2>

<p>The fundamental thing in Rousseauistic morality is not,
as we have seen, the assertion that man is naturally
good, but the denial of the “civil war in the cave.”
Though this denial is not complete in Rousseau himself,
nothing is more certain than that his whole tendency is
away from this form of dualism. The beautiful soul does
the right thing not as a result of effort, but spontaneously,
unconsciously and almost inevitably. In fact the beautiful
soul can scarcely be said to be a voluntary agent at all.
“Nature” acts in him and for him. This minimizing of
moral struggle and deliberation and choice, this drift towards
a naturalistic fatalism, as it may be termed, is a
far more significant thing in Rousseau than his optimism.
One may as a matter of fact eliminate dualism in favor of
nature and at the same time look on nature as evil. This
is precisely what one is likely to do if one sees no alternative
to temperamental living, while judging those who
live temperamentally not by their “ideal,” that is by
their feeling of their own loveliness, but by what they
actually do. One will become a realist in the sense that
came to be attached to this word during the latter part
of the nineteenth century. Rousseau himself is often
realistic in this sense when he interrupts his Arcadian
visions to tell us what actually occurred. In the “Confessions,”
as I have said, passages that recall Lamartine
alternate with passages that recall Zola, and the transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
from one type of passage to the other is often disconcertingly
sudden. In reading these realistic passages
of Rousseau we are led to reflect that his “nature” is
not, in practice, so remote from Taine’s nature as might
at first appear. “What we call <i>nature</i>,” says Taine, “is
this brood of secret passions, often maleficent, generally
vulgar, always blind, which tremble and fret within us, ill-covered
by the cloak of decency and reason under which
we try to disguise them; we think we lead them and they
lead us; we think our actions our own, they are theirs.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The transition from an optimistic to a pessimistic
naturalism can be followed with special clearness in the
stages by which the sentimental drama of the eighteenth
century passes over into the realistic drama of a later
period. Petit de Julleville contrasts the beginning and
the end of this development as follows: “[In the eighteenth
century] to please the public you had to say to it:
‘You are all at least at bottom good, virtuous, full of
feeling. Let yourselves go, follow your instincts; listen
to nature and you will do the right thing spontaneously.’
How changed times are! Nowadays<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> any one who wishes
to please, to be read and petted and admired, to pass for
great and become very rich, should address men as follows:
‘You are a vile pack of rogues, and profligates, you
have neither faith nor law; you are impelled by your
instincts alone and these instincts are ignoble. Do not try
though to mend matters, that would be of no use at all.’”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The connecting link between these different forms of
the drama is naturalistic fatalism, the suppression of
moral responsibility for either man’s goodness or badness.
Strictly speaking, the intrusion of the naturalistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
element into the realm of ethical values and the subversion
by it of deliberation and choice and of the normal
sequence of moral cause and effect is felt from the human
point of view not as fate at all, but as chance. Emotional
romanticism joins at this point with other forms of
romanticism, which all show a proclivity to prefer to
strict motivation, to probability in the Aristotelian sense,
what is fortuitous and therefore wonderful. This is only
another way of saying that the romanticist is moving
away from the genuinely dramatic towards melodrama.
Nothing is easier than to establish the connection between
emotional romanticism and the prodigious efflorescence
of melodrama, the irresponsible quest for thrills,
that has marked the past century. What perhaps distinguishes
this movement from any previous one is the
attempt to invest what is at bottom a melodramatic
view of life with philosophic and even religious significance.
By suppressing the “civil war in the cave” one
strikes at the very root of true drama. It does not then
much matter from the dramatic point of view whether the
burden of responsibility for good or evil of which you
have relieved the individual is shifted upon “nature”
or society. Shelley, for example, puts the blame for evil
on society. “Prometheus Unbound,” in which he has
developed his conception, is, judged as a play, only an
ethereal melodrama. The unaccountable collapse of
Zeus, a monster of unalloyed and unmotivated badness,
is followed by the gushing forth in man of an equally
unalloyed and unmotivated goodness. The whole genius
of Hugo, again, as I have said in speaking of his use of
antithesis, is melodramatic. His plays may be described
as parvenu melodramas. They abound in every variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of startling contrast and strange happening, the whole
pressed into the service of “problems” manifold and
even of a philosophy of history. At the same time the
poverty of ethical insight and true dramatic motivation
is dissimulated under profuse lyrical outpourings and
purple patches of local color. His Hernani actually glories
in not being a responsible agent, but an “unchained and
fatal force,”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and so more capable of striking astonishment
into himself and others. Yet the admirers of Hugo
would not only promote him to the first rank of poets,
but would have us share his own belief that he is a seer
and a prophet.</p>

<p>It may be objected that the great dramatists of the
past exalt this power of fate and thus diminish moral
responsibility. But the very sharpest distinction must
be drawn between the subrational fate of the emotional
romanticist and the superrational fate of Greek tragedy.
The fate of Æschylean tragedy, for instance, so far from
undermining moral responsibility rather reinforces it.
It is felt to be the revelation of a moral order of which
man’s experience at any particular moment is only an
infinitesimal fragment. It does not seem, like the subrational
fate of the emotional romanticist, the intrusion
into the human realm of an alien power whether friendly
or unfriendly. This point might be established by a study
of the so-called fate drama in Germany (<i>Schicksaltragödie</i>),
which, though blackly pessimistic, is closely related to
the optimistic sentimental drama of the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
The German fate drama is in its essence ignoble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
because its characters are specimens of sensitive morality&mdash;incapable,
that is, of opposing a firm human purpose
to inner impulse or outer impression. The fate that thus
wells up from the depths of nature and overwhelms their
wills is not only malign and ironical, but as Grillparzer
says, makes human deeds seem only “throws of the dice
in the blind night of chance.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> It would be easy to follow
similar conceptions of fate down through later literature
at least to the novels of Thomas Hardy.</p>

<p>Some of the earlier exponents of the sentimental
drama, like Diderot, were not so certain as one might
expect that the discarding of traditional decorum in
favor of “nature” would result practically in a reign of
pure loveliness. At one moment Diderot urges men to get
rid of the civil war in the cave in order that they may be
Arcadian, like the savages of the South Sea, but at other
moments&mdash;as in “Rameau’s Nephew”&mdash;he shows a
somewhat closer grip on the problem of what will actually
come to pass when a man throws off the conventions of
a highly organized civilization and sets out to live temperamentally.
Diderot sees clearly that he will be that
least primitive of all beings, the Bohemian. Rameau’s
nephew, in his irresponsibility and emotional instability,
in the kaleidoscopic shiftings of his mood, anticipates
all the romantic Bohemians and persons of “artistic
temperament” who were to afflict the nineteenth century.
But he is more than a mere æsthete. At moments we can
discern in him the first lineaments of the superman, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
knows no law save the law of might. One should recollect
that the actual influence of Diderot in France fell in the
second rather than in the first half of the nineteenth
century&mdash;was upon the realists rather than upon the
romanticists. The same men that had a cult for Diderot
admired the Vautrins and the Rastignacs of Balzac
and the Julien Sorel of Stendhal. These characters are
little Napoleons. They live temperamentally in the midst
of a highly organized society, but they set aside its conventions
of right and wrong in favor, not of æsthetic
enjoyment, but of power.</p>

<p>The ideal of romantic morality, as was seen in the last
chapter, is altruism. The real, it should be clear from the
examples I have been citing, is always egoism. But egoism
may assume very different forms. As to the main
forms of egoism in men who have repudiated outer control
without acquiring self-control we may perhaps revive
profitably the old Christian classification of the three
lusts&mdash;the lust of knowledge, the lust of sensation, and
the lust of power. Goethe indeed may be said to have
treated these three main ways of being temperamental
in three of his early characters&mdash;the lust of knowledge in
“Faust,” the lust of sensation in “Werther,” and the lust
of power in “Götz.” If we view life solely from the naturalistic
level and concern ourselves solely with the world
of action, we are justified in neglecting, like Hobbes, the
other lusts and putting supreme emphasis on the lust
for power.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Professor F.J. Mather, Jr., has distinguished
between “hard” and “soft” sentimentalists.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> His distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
might perhaps be brought more closely into line with
my own distinctions if I ventured to coin a word and to
speak of hard and soft temperamentalists. The soft temperamentalist
will prove unable to cope in the actual world
with the hard temperamentalist, and is very likely to become
his tool. Balzac has very appropriately made Lucien
de Rubempré, the romantic poet and a perfect type of a
soft temperamentalism, the tool of Vautrin, the superman.</p>

<p>Here indeed is the supreme opposition between the
ideal and the real in romantic morality. The ideal to which
Rousseau invites us is either the primitivistic anarchy of
the “Second Discourse,” in which egoism is tempered by
“natural pity,” or else a state such as is depicted in the
“Social Contract,” in which egoism is held in check by
a disinterested “general will.” The preliminary to achieving
either of these ideals is that the traditional checks on
human nature should be removed. But in exact proportion
as this programme of emancipation is carried out
what emerges in the real world is not the mythical will
to brotherhood, but the ego and its fundamental will to
power. Give a bootblack half the universe, according to
Carlyle, and he will soon be quarreling with the owner
of the other half. He will if he is a very temperamental
bootblack. Perhaps indeed all other evils in life may be
reduced to the failure to check that something in man
that is reaching out for more and ever for more. In a
society in which the traditional inhibitions are constantly
growing weaker, the conflict I have just sketched between
the ideal and the real is becoming more and more
acute. The soft temperamentalists are overflowing with
beautiful professions of brotherly love, and at the same
time the hard temperamentalists are reaching out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
everything in sight; and inasmuch as the hard temperamentalists
operate not in dreamland, but in the real
world, they are only too plainly setting the tone. Very
often, of course, the same temperamentalist has his hard
and his soft side. The triumph of egoism over altruism
in the relations between man and man is even more
evident in the relations between nation and nation. The
egoism that results from the inbreeding of temperament
on a national scale runs in the case of the strong nations
into imperialism.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> We have not reflected sufficiently on
the fact that the soft temperamentalist Rousseau is more
than any other one person the father of <i>Kultur</i>;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and
that the exponents of Kultur in our own day have been
revealed as the hardest of hard temperamentalists.</p>

<p>To understand the particular craving that is met by
Rousseauistic idealism one would need to go with some
care into the psychology of the half-educated man. The
half-educated man may be defined as the man who has
acquired a degree of critical self-consciousness sufficient
to detach him from the standards of his time and place,
but not sufficient to acquire the new standards that come
with a more thorough cultivation. It was pointed out long
ago that the characteristic of the half-educated man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that he is incurably restless; that he is filled with every
manner of desire. In contrast with him the uncultivated
man, the peasant, let us say, and the man of high cultivation
have few and simple desires. Thus Socrates had
fewer and simpler desires than the average Athenian. But
what is most noteworthy about the half-educated man
is not simply that he harbors many desires and is therefore
incurably restless, but that these desires are so often
incompatible. He craves various good things, but is not
willing to pay the price&mdash;not willing to make the necessary
renunciations. He pushes to an extreme what is after
all a universal human proclivity&mdash;the wish to have
one’s cake and eat it too. Thus, while remaining on the
naturalistic level, he wishes to have blessings that accrue
only to those who rise to the humanistic or religious levels.
He wishes to live in “a universe with the lid off,” to
borrow a happy phrase from the pragmatist, and at the
same time to enjoy the peace and brotherhood that are
the fruits of restraint. The moral indolence of the Rousseauist
is such that he is unwilling to adjust himself to the
truth of the human law; and though living naturalistically,
he is loath to recognize that what actually prevails
on the naturalistic level is the law of cunning and the law
of force. He thus misses the reality of both the human
and the natural law and in the pursuit of a vague Arcadian
longing falls into sheer unreality. I am indeed overstating
the case so far as Rousseau is concerned. He makes plain
in the “Emile” that the true law of nature is not the law
of love but the law of force. Emile is to be released from
the discipline of the human law and given over to the
discipline of nature; and this means in practice that he
will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> “to bow his neck beneath the hard yoke of
physical necessity.” In so far the “nature” of Emile is
no Arcadian dream. Where the Arcadian dreaming begins
is when Rousseau assumes that an Emile who has
learned the lesson of force from Nature herself, will not
pass along this lesson to others, whether citizens of his
own or some other country, but will rather display in his
dealings with them an ideal fraternity. In the early stages
of the naturalistic movement, in Hobbes and Shaftesbury,
for example, egoism and altruism, the idea of power
and the idea of sympathy, are more sharply contrasted
than they are in Rousseau and the later romanticists.
Shaftesbury assumes in human nature an altruistic impulse
or will to brotherhood that will be able to cope
successfully with the will to power that Hobbes declares
to be fundamental. Many of the romanticists, as we have
seen, combine the cult of power with the cult of brotherhood.
Hercules, as in Shelley’s poem, is to bow down
before Prometheus, the lover of mankind. The extreme
example, however, is probably William Blake. He proclaims
himself of the devil’s party, he glorifies a free
expansion of energy, he looks upon everything that restricts
this expansion as synonymous with evil. At the
same time he pushes his exaltation of sympathy to the
verge of the grotesque.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Such indeed is the jumble of incompatibles in Blake
that he would rest an illimitable compassion on the psychology
of the superman. For nothing is more certain
than that the “Marriage of Heaven and Hell” is among
other things a fairly complete anticipation of Nietzsche.
The reasons are worth considering why the idea of power
and the idea of sympathy which Blake and so many other
romanticists hoped to unite have once more come to seem
antipodal, why in the late stages of the movement one
finds a Nietzsche and a Tolstoy, just as in its early stages
one finds a Hobbes and a Shaftesbury. It is plain, first of
all, that what brought the two cults together for a time
was their common hatred of the past. With the triumph
over the past fairly complete, the incompatibility of
power and sympathy became increasingly manifest.
Nietzsche’s attitude is that of a Prometheus whose sympathy
for mankind has changed to disgust on seeing the
use that they are actually making of their emancipation.
Humanitarian sympathy seemed to him to be tending
not merely to a subversion, but to an inversion of values,
to a positive preference for the trivial and the ignoble.
He looked with special loathing on that side of the movement
that is symbolized in its homage to the ass. The
inevitable flying apart of power and sympathy was further
hastened in Nietzsche and others by the progress
of evolution. Darwinism was dissipating the Arcadian
mist through which nature had been viewed by Rousseau
and his early followers. The gap is wide between Tennyson’s
nature “red in tooth and claw” and the tender
and pitiful nature of Wordsworth.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Nietzsche’s preaching
of ruthlessness is therefore a protest against the sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
unreality of those who wish to be natural and at the same
time sympathetic. But how are we to get a real scale of
values to oppose to an indiscriminate sympathy? It is
here that Nietzsche shows that he is caught in the same
fatal coil of naturalism as the humanitarian. He accepts
the naturalistic corruption of conscience which underlies
all other naturalistic corruptions. “The will to overcome
an emotion,” he says, “is ultimately only the will
of another or of several other emotions.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> All he can do
with this conception of conscience is to set over against
the humanitarian suppression of values a scale of values
based on force and not a true scale of values based on the
degree to which one imposes or fails to impose on one’s
temperamental self a human law of vital control. The
opposition between a Nietzsche and a Tolstoy is therefore
not specially significant; it is only that between the hard
and the soft temperamentalist. To be sure Nietzsche can
on occasion speak very shrewdly about the evils that
have resulted from temperamentalism&mdash;especially from
the passion for an untrammeled self-expression. But the
superman himself is a most authentic descendant of the
original genius in whom we first saw this passion dominant.
The imagination of the superman, spurning every
centre of control, traditional or otherwise, so coöperates
with his impulses and desires as to give them “infinitude,”
that is so as to make them reach out for more and
ever for more. The result is a frenzied romanticism.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Proportionateness is strange to us, let us confess it
to ourselves,” says Nietzsche. “Our itching is really the
itching for the infinite, the immeasurable.” How the
humanitarian loses proportionateness is plain; it is by his
readiness to sacrifice to sympathy the ninety per cent or
so of the virtues that imply self-control. The superman
would scarcely seem to redress the balance by getting rid
of the same restraining virtues in favor of power. He
simply oscillates wildly from the excess of which he is
conscious in others or in himself into the opposite excess,
at imminent peril in either case to the ethical basis of
civilization. The patterns or models that the past had set
up for imitation and with reference to which one might
rein in his lusts and impose upon them proportionateness
are rejected by every type of romantic expansionist,
not only as Nietzsche says, because they do not satisfy
the yearning for the infinite, but also, as we have seen,
because they do not satisfy the yearning for unity and
immediacy. Now so far as the forms of the eighteenth
century were concerned the romantic expansionist had
legitimate grounds for protest. But because the rationalism
and artificial decorum of that period failed to
satisfy, he goes on to attack the analytical intellect and
decorum in general and this attack is entirely illegitimate.
It may be affirmed on the contrary that the power by
which we multiply distinctions is never so necessary as
in an individualistic age, an age that has broken with
tradition on the ground that it wishes to be more imaginative
and immediate. There are various ways of being
imaginative and immediate, and analysis is needed, not
to build up some abstract system but to discriminate
between the actual data of experience and so to determine
which one of these ways it is expedient to follow if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
one wishes to become wise and happy. It is precisely at
such moments of individualistic break with the past that
the sophist stands ready to juggle with general terms,
and the only protection against such juggling is to define
these terms with the aid of the most unflinching analysis.
Thus Bergson would have us believe that there are
in France two main types of philosophy, a rationalistic
type that goes back to Descartes and an intuitive type
that goes back to Pascal,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and gives us to understand
that, inasmuch as he is an intuitionist, he is in the line of
descent from Pascal. Monstrous sophistries lurk in this
simple assertion, sophistries which if they go uncorrected
are enough to wreck civilization. The only remedy is to
define the word intuition, to discriminate practically and
by their fruits between subrational and superrational
intuition. When analyzed and defined in this way subrational
intuition will be found to be associated with vital
impulse (<i>élan vital</i>) and superrational intuition with a
power of vital control (<i>frein vital</i>) over this impulse; and
furthermore it will be clear that this control must be
exercised if men are to be drawn towards a common
centre, not in dreamland, but in the real world. So far
then from its being true that the man who analyzes must
needs see things in disconnection dead and spiritless, it is
only by analysis that he is, in an individualistic age, put
on the pathway of true unity, and also of the rôle of the
imagination in achieving this unity. For there is need to
discriminate between the different types of imagination
no less than between the different types of intuition. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
will find through such analysis that the centre of normal
human experience that is to serve as a check on impulse
(so far at least as it is something distinct from the mere
convention of one’s age and time) can be apprehended
only with the aid of the imagination. This is only another
way of saying that the reality that is set above one’s
ordinary self is not a fixed absolute but can be glimpsed,
if at all, only through a veil of illusion and is indeed inseparable
from the illusion. This realm of insight cannot be
finally formulated for the simple reason that it is anterior
to formulæ. It must therefore from the point of view of
an intellect it transcends seem infinite though in a very
different sense from the outer infinite of expansive desire.</p>

<p>This inner or human infinite, so far from being incompatible
with decorum, is the source of true decorum.
True decorum is only the pulling back and disciplining of
impulse to the proportionateness that has been perceived
with the aid of what one may term the ethical or generalizing
imagination. To dismiss like the romantic expansionist
everything that limits or restricts the lust of
knowledge or of power or of sensation as arbitrary and
artificial is to miss true decorum and at the same time to
sink, as a Greek would say, from ethos to pathos. If one is
to avoid this error one must, as Hamlet counsels, “in the
very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of
passion, acquire and beget a temperance that may give it
smoothness.” This is probably the best of all modern
definitions of decorum simply because it is the most experimental.
In general all that has been said about the
ethical imagination is not to be taken as a fine-spun
theory, but as an attempt however imperfect to give an
account of actual experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>One may report from observation another trait of
truly ethical art, art which is at once imaginative and
decorous. It is not merely intense, as art that is imaginative
at the expense of decorum may very well be,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> it has
a restrained and humanized intensity&mdash;intensity on a
background of calm. The presence of the ethical imagination
whether in art or life<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> is always known as an element
of calm.</p>

<p>In art that has the ethical quality, and I am again not
setting up a metaphysical theory but reporting from
observation, the calm that comes from imaginative insight
into the universal is inextricably blended with an
element of uniqueness&mdash;with a something that belongs
to a particular time and place and individual. The truth
to the universal, as Aristotle would say, gives the work
verisimilitude and the truth to the particular satisfies
man’s deep-seated craving for novelty; so that the best
art unites the probable with the wonderful. But the
probable, one cannot insist too often, is won no less than
the wonderful with the aid of the imagination and so is
of the very soul of art. The romanticist who is ready to
sacrifice the probable to the wonderful and to look on the
whole demand for verisimilitude as an academic superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
is prone to assume that he has a monopoly of
soul and imagination. But the word soul is at least in as
much need of Socratic definition as the word intuition.
It is possible, for example, with the aid of the ethical
imagination so to partake of the ultimate element of calm
as to rise to the religious level. The man who has risen
to this level has a soul, but it is a soul of peace. Both soul
and imagination are also needed to achieve the fine adjustment
and mediation of the humanist. It is not enough,
however, to have a religious or a humanistic soul if one
is to be a creator or even a fully equipped critic of art.
For art rests primarily not on ethical but æsthetic perception.
This perception itself varies widely according to
the art involved. One may, for instance, be musically
perceptive and at the same time lack poetic perception.
To be a creator in any art one must possess furthermore
the technique of this art&mdash;something that is more or less
separable from its “soul” in any sense of the word. It is
possible to put a wildly romantic soul into art, as has often
been done in the Far East, and at the same time to
be highly conventional or traditional in one’s technique.
Writers like Mérimée, Renan, and Maupassant again are
faithful in the main to the technique of French prose
that was worked out during the classical period, but combine
with this technique an utterly unclassical “soul.”</p>

<p>Rules, especially perhaps rules as to what to avoid,
may be of aid in acquiring technique, but are out of place
in dealing with the soul of art. There one passes from
rules to principles. The only rule, if we are to achieve art
that has an ethical soul, is to view life with some degree
of imaginative wholeness. Art that has technique without
soul in either the classical or romantic sense, and so fails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
either to inspire elevation or awaken wonder, is likely
to be felt as a barren virtuosity. The pseudo-classicist was
often unduly minute in the rules he laid down for technique
or outer form, as one may say, and then ignored
the ethical imagination or inner form entirely, or else set
up as a substitute mere didacticism. Since pseudo-classic
work of this type plainly lacked soul and imagination,
and since the romanticist felt and felt rightly that he himself
had a soul and imagination, he concluded wrongly
that soul and imagination are romantic monopolies.
Like the pseudo-classicist, he inclines to identify high
seriousness in art, something that can only come from
the exercise of the ethical imagination at its best, with
mere preaching, only he differs from the pseudo-classicist
in insisting that preaching should be left to divines. One
should insist, on the contrary, that the mark of genuinely
ethical art, art that is highly serious, is that it is free from
preaching. Sophocles is more ethical than Euripides for
the simple reason that he views life with more imaginative
wholeness. At the same time he is much less given
to preaching than Euripides. He does not, as FitzGerald
says, interrupt the action and the exhibition of character
through action in order to “jaw philosophy.”</p>

<p>It is not unusual for the modern artist to seek, like
Euripides, to dissimulate the lack of true ethical purpose
in his work by agitating various problems. But problems
come and go, whereas human nature abides. One may agitate
problems without number, and yet lack imaginative
insight into the abiding element in human nature. Moreover,
not being of the soul of art, the problem that one
agitates is in danger of being a clogging intellectualism.
Furthermore to seek in problems an equivalent for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
definition and purpose that the ethical imagination alone
can give is to renew, often in an aggravated form, the
neo-classical error. The moralizing of the pseudo-classic
dramatist, even though dull and misplaced, was usually
sound enough in itself; whereas the moralizing of those
who seek nowadays to use the stage as a pulpit, resting
as it does on false humanitarian postulates, is in itself
dubious. The problem play succeeds not infrequently in
being at once dull and indecent.</p>

<p>The problem play is often very superior in technique
or outer form to the earlier romantic drama, but it still
suffers from the same lack of inner form, inasmuch as its
social purpose cannot take the place of true human
purpose based on imaginative insight into the universal.
The lack of inner form in so much modern drama and art
in general can be traced to the original unsoundness of
the break with pseudo-classic formalism. To a pseudo-classic
art that lacked every kind of perceptiveness the
Rousseauist opposed æsthetic perceptiveness, and it is
something, one must admit, thus to have discovered the
senses. But to his æsthetic perceptiveness he failed, as I
have already said, to add ethical perceptiveness because
of his inability to distinguish between ethical perceptiveness
and mere didacticism, and so when asked to put ethical
purpose into art he replied that art should be pursued
for its own sake (<i>l’art pour l’art</i>) and that “beauty is its
own excuse for being.” One should note here the transformation
that this pure æstheticism brought about
in the meaning of the word beauty itself. For the Greek
beauty resided in proportion,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and proportion can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
attained only with the aid of the ethical imagination.
With the elimination of the ethical element from the soul
of art the result is an imagination that is free to wander
wild with the emancipated emotions. The result is likely
to be art in which a lively æsthetic perceptiveness is
not subordinated to any whole, art that is unstructural,
however it may abound in vivid and picturesque details;
and a one-sided art of this kind the romanticist does not
hesitate to call beautiful. “If we let the reason sleep and
are content to watch a succession of dissolving views,”
says Mr. Elton of Shelley’s “Revolt of Islam,” “the
poem is seen at once to overflow with beauty.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Mere
reason is not strictly speaking a sufficient remedy for this
unstructural type of “beauty.” Thus Chateaubriand’s
reason is on the side of proportion and all the classical
virtues but his imagination is not (and we cannot repeat
too often that it is what a man is imaginatively and not
what he preaches that really counts). Instead of siding
with his reason and aiding it to ethical perception Chateaubriand’s
imagination is the free playmate of his emotions.
“What did I care for all these futilities” (i.e. his
functions as cabinet minister), he exclaims, “I who never
cared for anything except for my dreams, and even then
on condition that they should last only for a night.” When
a man has once spoken in that vein sensible people will
pay little heed to what he preaches; for they will be certain
that the driving power of his work and personality
is elsewhere. The imagination holds the balance of power
between the reason and the perceptions of sense, and
Chateaubriand’s imagination is plainly on the side of
sensuous adventure. This vagabondage of the imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
appears especially in his imagistic trend, in his pursuit
of the descriptive detail for its own sake. To set out
like Chateaubriand to restore the monarchy and the Christian
religion and instead to become the founder of “<i>l’école
des images à tout prix</i>” is an especially striking form of the
contrast in romantic morality between the ideal and the
real.</p>

<p>The attempt that we have been studying to divorce
beauty from ethics led in the latter part of the eighteenth
century to the rise of a nightmare subject,&mdash;æsthetics.
Shaftesbury indeed, as we have seen already, anticipates
the favorite romantic doctrine that beauty is truth and
truth beauty, which means in practice to rest both truth
and beauty upon a fluid emotionalism. Thus to deal
æsthetically with truth is an error of the first magnitude,
but it is also an error, though a less serious one, to see only
the æsthetic element in beauty. For beauty to be complete
must have not only æsthetic perceptiveness but
order and proportion; and this brings us back again to
the problem of the ethical imagination and the permanent
model or pattern with reference to which it seeks to impose
measure and proportion upon sensuous perception
and expansive desire. We should not hesitate to say that
beauty loses most of its meaning when divorced from
ethics even though every æsthete in the world should
arise and denounce us as philistines. To rest beauty upon
feeling as the very name æsthetics implies, is to rest it
upon what is ever shifting. Nor can we escape from this
endless mobility with the aid of physical science, for
physical science does not itself rise above the naturalistic
flux. After eliminating from beauty the permanent pattern
and the ethical imagination with the aid of which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
perceived, a man will be ready to term beautiful anything
that reflects his ordinary or temperamental self. Diderot
is a sentimentalist and so he sees as much beauty in the
sentimentalist Richardson as in Homer. If a man is
psychically restless he will see beauty only in motion.
The Italian futurist Marinetti says that for him a rushing
motor car is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.
A complete sacrifice of the principle of repose in
beauty (which itself arises from the presence of the ethical
imagination) to the suggesting of motion such as has been
seen in certain recent schools, runs practically into a mixture
of charlatanism and madness. “He that is giddy
thinks the world goes round,” says Shakespeare, and the
exponents of certain ultra-modern movements in painting
are simply trying to paint their inner giddiness. As
a matter of fact the pretension of the æsthete to have
a purely personal vision of beauty and then treat as a
philistine every one who does not accept it, is intolerable.
Either beauty cannot be defined at all or we must say that
only is beautiful which seems so to the right kind of
man, and the right kind of man is plainly he whose total
attitude towards life is correct, who views life with some
degree of imaginative wholeness, which is only another
way of saying that the problem of beauty is inseparable
from the ethical problem. In an absolute sense nobody
can see life steadily and see it whole; but we may at least
move towards steadiness and wholeness. The æsthete is
plainly moving in an opposite direction; he is becoming
more and more openly a votary of the god Whirl. His
lack of inner form is an error not of æsthetics but of
general philosophy.</p>

<p>The romantic imagination, the imagination that is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
drawn back to any ethical centre and so is free to wander
wild in its own empire of chimeras, has indeed a place in
life. To understand what this place is one needs to emphasize
the distinction between art that has high seriousness
and art that is merely recreative. The serious
moments of life are moments of tension, of concentration
on either the natural or the human law. But Apollo
cannot always be bending the bow. Man needs at times
to relax, and one way of relaxing is to take refuge for
a time in some land of chimeras, to follow the Arcadian
gleam. He may then come back to the real world, the
world of active effort, solaced and refreshed. But it is
only with reference to some ethical centre that we may
determine what art is soundly recreative, in what forms
of adventure the imagination may innocently indulge.
The romanticist should recollect that among other forms
of adventure is what Ben Jonson terms “a bold adventure
for hell”; and that a not uncommon nostalgia is
what the French call <i>la nostalgie de la boue</i>&mdash;man’s
nostalgia for his native mud. Because we are justified at
times, as Lamb urges, in wandering imaginatively beyond
“the diocese of strict conscience,” it does not follow
that we may, like him, treat Restoration Comedy as a
sort of fairyland; for Restoration Comedy is a world not
of pure but of impure imagination.</p>

<p>Lamb’s paradox, however, is harmless compared with
what we have just been seeing in Chateaubriand. With
a dalliant imagination that entitles him at best to play
a recreative rôle, he sets up as a religious teacher.
Michelet again has been described as an “entertainer
who believes himself a prophet,” and this description fits
many other Rousseauists. The æsthete who assumes an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
apocalyptic pose is an especially flagrant instance of the
huddling together of incompatible desires. He wishes
to sport with Amaryllis in the shade and at the same
time enjoy the honors that belong only to the man who
scorns delights and lives laborious days. For the exercise
of the ethical imagination, it is hardly necessary to say,
involves effort. Perhaps no one has ever surpassed Rousseau
himself in the art of which I have already spoken,&mdash;that
of giving to moral indolence a semblance of profound
philosophy.</p>

<p>One cannot indeed always affirm that the Rousseauist
is by the quality of his imagination an entertainer pure
and simple. His breaking down of barriers and running
together of the planes of being results at times in ambiguous
mixtures&mdash;gleams of insight that actually seem to
minister to fleshliness. One may cite as an example the
“voluptuous religiosity” that certain critics have discovered
in Wagner.</p>

<p>The romanticist will at once protest against the application
of ethical standards to Wagner or any other musician.
Music, he holds, is the most soulful of the arts and
so the least subject to ethics. For the same reason it is the
chief of arts and also&mdash;in view of the fact that romanticists
have a monopoly of soul&mdash;the most romantic.
One should not allow to pass unchallenged this notion that
because music is filled with soul it is therefore subject to
no ethical centre, but should be treated as a pure enchantment.
The Greeks were as a matter of fact much
concerned with the ethical quality of music. Certain
musical modes, the Doric for example, had as they
believed a virile “soul,” other modes like the Lydian had
the contrary (“Lap me in soft Lydian airs”). For the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
reason that music is the most appealing of the arts (song,
says Aristotle, is the sweetest of all things) they were
especially anxious that this art should be guarded from
perversion.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Without attempting a full discussion of a
difficult subject for which I have no competency, it will be
enough to point out that the plain song that prevailed
in Christian churches for over a thousand years evidently
had a very different “soul,” a soul that inspired to
prayer and peace, from much specifically romantic music
that has a soul of restlessness, of infinite indeterminate
desire. The result of the failure to recognize this distinction
is very often a hybrid art. Berlioz showed a rather
peculiar conception of religion when he took pride in
the fact that his Requiem (!) Mass frightened one of the
listeners into a fit.</p>

<p>The ethical confusion that arises from the romantic
cult of “soul” and the closely allied tendency towards a
hybrid art&mdash;art that lacks high seriousness without being
frankly recreative&mdash;may also be illustrated from the
field of poetry. Many volumes have been published and
are still being published on Browning as a philosophic and
religious teacher. But Browning can pass as a prophet
only with the half-educated person, the person who
has lost traditional standards and has at the same time
failed to work out with the aid of the ethical imagination
some fresh scale of values and in the meanwhile lives
impulsively and glorifies impulse. Like the half-educated
person, Browning is capable of almost any amount of
intellectual and emotional subtlety, and like the half-educated
person he is deficient in inner form: that is he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
deals with experience impressionistically without reference
to any central pattern or purpose.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> It is enough that
the separate moments of this experience should each
stand forth like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent5">The quick sharp scratch</div>
<div class="verse">And blue spurt of a lighted match.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One may take as an illustration of this drift towards the
melodramatic the “Ring and the Book.” The method of
this poem is peripheral, that is, the action is viewed not
from any centre but as refracted through the temperaments
of the actors. The twelve monologues of which the
poem is composed illustrate the tendency of romantic
writing to run into some “song of myself” or “tale of
my heart.” The “Ring and the Book” is not only off the
centre, but is designed to raise a positive prejudice against
everything that is central. Guido, for example, had observed
decorum, had done all the conventional things and
is horrible. Pompilia, the beautiful soul, had the great
advantage of having had an indecorous start. Being the
daughter of a drab, she is not kept from heeding the voice
of nature. Caponsacchi again shows the beauty of his soul
by violating the decorum of the priesthood. This least
representative of priests wins our sympathy, not by his
Christianity, but by his lyrical intensity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">O lyric love, half angel and half bird,</div>
<div class="verse">And all a wonder and a wild desire!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Browning here escapes for once from the clogging intellectualism
that makes nearly all the “Ring and the
Book” an indeterminate blend of verse and prose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
achieves true poetry though not of the highest type.
The hybrid character of his art, due partly to a lack of
outer form, to a defective poetical technique, arises even
more from a lack of inner form&mdash;from an attempt to
give a semblance of seriousness to what is at bottom
unethical. The aged Pope may well meditate on the
revolution that is implied in the substitution of the
morality of the beautiful soul for that of St. Augustine.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
In seeming to accept this revolution Browning’s Pope
comes near to breaking all records, even in the romantic
movement, for paradox and indecorum.</p>

<p>At bottom the war between humanist and romanticist
is so irreconcilable because the one is a mediator and the
other an extremist. Browning would have us admire his
Pompilia because her love knows no limit;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> but a secular
love like hers must know a limit, must be decorous in
short, if it is to be distinguished from mere emotional
intensity. It is evident that the romantic ideal of art for
art’s sake meant in the real world art for sensation’s
sake. The glorification of a love knowing no limit, that a
Browning or a Hugo sets up as a substitute for philosophy
and even for religion, is therefore closely affiliated in
practice with the <i>libido sentiendi</i>. “It is hard,” wrote
Stendhal, in 1817, “not to see what the nineteenth century
desires. A love of strong emotions is its true character.”
The romantic tendency to push every emotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to an extreme, regardless of decorum, is not much affected
by what the romanticist preaches or by the problems he
agitates. Doudan remarks of a mother who loses her child
in Hugo’s “Nôtre Dame de Paris,” that “her rage after
this loss has nothing to equal it in the roarings of a lioness
or tigress who has been robbed of her young. She becomes
vulgar by excess of despair. It is the saturnalia of
maternal grief. You see that this woman belongs to a
world in which neither the instincts nor the passions have
that divine aroma which imposes on them some kind of
measure&mdash;the dignity or decorum that contains a moral
principle; … When the passions no longer have this
check, they should be relegated to the menagerie along
with leopards and rhinoceroses, and, strange circumstance,
when the passions do recognize this check they
produce more effect on the spectators than unregulated
outbursts; they give evidence of more depth.” This superlativeness,
as one may say, that Hugo displays in his
picture of maternal grief is not confined to the emotional
romanticist. It appears, for example, among the intellectual
romanticists of the seventeenth century and
affected the very forms of language. Molière and others
ridiculed the adjectives and adverbs with which the
<i>précieuses</i> sought to express their special type of superlativeness
and intensity (<i>extrêmement</i>, <i>furieusement</i>, <i>terriblement</i>,
etc.). Alfred de Musset’s assertion that the
chief difference between classicist and romanticist is
found in the latter’s greater proneness to adjectives is not
altogether a jest. It has been said that the pessimist uses
few, the optimist many adjectives; but the use of adjectives
and above all of superlatives would rather seem to
grow with one’s expansiveness, and no movement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
ever more expansive than that we are studying. Dante,
according to Rivarol, is very sparing of adjectives. His
sentence tends to maintain itself by the verb and substantive
alone. In this as in other respects Dante is at
the opposite pole from the expansionist.</p>

<p>The romantic violence of expression is at once a proof
of “soul” and a protest against the tameness and smugness
of the pseudo-classicist. The human volcano must
overflow at times in a lava of molten words. “Damnation!”
cries Berlioz, “I could crush a red-hot iron between
my teeth.”<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The disproportion between the outer
incident and the emotion that the Rousseauist expends
on it is often ludicrous.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The kind of force that the man
attains who sees in emotional intensity a mark of spiritual
distinction, and deems moderation identical with mediocrity,
is likely to be the force of delirium or fever. What
one sees in “Werther,” says Goethe himself, is weakness
seeking to give itself the prestige of strength; and this
remark goes far. There is in some of the romanticists
a suggestion not merely of spiritual but of physical
anæmia.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Still the intensity is often that of a strong but
unbridled spirit. Pleasure is pushed to the point where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
runs over into pain, and pain to the point where it becomes
an auxiliary of pleasure. The <i>âcre baiser</i> of the
“Nouvelle Héloïse” that so scandalized Voltaire presaged
even more than a literary revolution. The poems of A. de
Musset in particular contain an extraordinary perversion
of the Christian doctrine of purification through suffering.
There is something repellent to the genuine Christian as
well as to the worldling in what one is tempted to call
Musset’s Epicurean cult of pain.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Moments of superlative intensity whether of pleasure
or pain must in the nature of the case be brief&mdash;mere
spasms or paroxysms; and one might apply to the whole
school the term paroxyst and spasmodist assumed by
certain minor groups during the past century. The Rousseauist
is in general loath to rein in his emotional vehemence,
to impair the zest with which he responds to the
solicitations of sense, by any reference to the “future and
sum of time,” by any reference, that is, to an ethical
purpose. He would enjoy his thrill pure and unalloyed,
and this amounts in practice to the pursuit of the beautiful
or sensation-crowded moment. Saint-Preux says of
the days spent with Julie that a “sweet ecstasy” absorbed
“their whole duration and gathered it together in
a point like that of eternity. There was for me neither
past nor future, and I enjoyed at one and the same time
the delights of a thousand centuries.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The superlativist
one might suppose could go no further. But in the deliberate
sacrifice of all ethical values to the beautiful moment
Browning has perhaps improved even on Rousseau:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">Truth, that’s brighter than gem,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Trust, that’s purer than pearl,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Brightest truth, purest trust in the universe&mdash;all were for me</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In the kiss of one girl.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Browning entitles the poem from which I am quoting
<i>Summum Bonum</i>. The supreme good it would appear is
identical with the supreme thrill.</p>

<p>I have already said enough to make clear that the title
of this chapter and the last is in a way a misnomer. There
is no such thing as romantic morality. The innovations in
ethics that are due to romanticism reduce themselves on
close scrutiny to a vast system of naturalistic camouflage.
To understand how this camouflage has been so successful
one needs to connect Rousseauism with the Baconian
movement. Scientific progress had inspired man with a
new confidence in himself at the same time that the positive
and critical method by which it had been achieved detached
him from the past and its traditional standards of
good and evil. To break with tradition on sound lines one
needs to apply the utmost keenness of analysis not merely
to the natural but to the human law. But man’s analytical
powers were very much taken up with the new task of
mastering the natural law, so much so that he seemed
incapable of further analytical effort, but longed rather
for relaxation from his sustained concentration of intellect
and imagination on the physical order. At the same
time he was so elated by the progress he was making in
this order that he was inclined to assume a similar advance
on the moral plane and to believe that this advance
could also be achieved collectively. A collective salvation
of this kind without any need of a concentration of the
intellect and imagination is precisely what was opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
up to him by the Rousseauistic “ideal” of brotherhood.
This “ideal,” as I have tried to show, was only a projection
of the Arcadian imagination on the void. But in
the abdication of analysis and critical judgment, which
would have reduced it to a purely recreative rôle, this
Arcadian dreaming was enabled to set up as a serious
philosophy, and to expand into innumerable Utopias.
Many who might have taken alarm at the humanitarian
revolution in ethics were reassured by the very fervor
with which its promoters continued to utter the old words&mdash;conscience,
virtue, etc. No one puts more stress than
Rousseau himself on conscience, while in the very act of
transforming conscience from an inner check into an
expansive emotion.</p>

<p>We have seen that as a result of this transformation of
conscience, temperament is emancipated from both inner
and outer control and that this emancipation tends in the
real world to the rise of two main types&mdash;the Bohemian
and the superman, both unprimitive, inasmuch as primitive
man is governed not by temperament but by convention;
and that what actually tends to prevail in such
a temperamental world in view of the superior “hardness”
of the superman, is the law of cunning and the law
of force. So far as the Rousseauists set up the mere emancipation
of temperament as a serious philosophy, they
are to be held responsible for the results of this emancipation
whether displayed in the lust of power or the lust of
sensation. But the lust of power and the lust of sensation,
such as they appear, for example, in the so-called realism
of the later nineteenth century, are not in themselves
identical with romanticism. Many of the realists, like
Flaubert, as I have already pointed out, are simply bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and disillusioned Rousseauists who are expressing their
nausea at the society that has actually arisen from the
emancipation of temperament in themselves and others.
The essence of Rousseauistic as of other romance, I may
repeat, is to be found not in any mere fact, not even in the
fact of sensation, but in a certain quality of the imagination.
Rousseauism is, it is true, an emancipation of impulse,
especially of the impulse of sex. Practically all the
examples I have chosen of the tense and beautiful moment
are erotic. But what one has even here, as the imagination
grows increasingly romantic, is less the reality than
the dream of the beautiful moment, an intensity that is
achieved only in the tower of ivory. This point can be
made clear only by a fuller study of the romantic conception
of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">ROMANTIC LOVE</span></h2>

<p>What first strikes one in Rousseau’s attitude towards
love is the separation, even wider here perhaps than elsewhere,
between the ideal and the real. He dilates in the
“Confessions” on the difference of the attachment that
he felt when scarcely more than a boy for two young
women of Geneva, Mademoiselle Vulson and Mademoiselle
Goton. His attachment for the latter was real in a
sense that Zola would have understood. His attachment
for Mademoiselle Vulson reminds one rather of that of a
mediæval knight for his lady. The same contrast runs
through Rousseau’s life. “Seamstresses, chambermaids,
shop-girls,” he says, “attracted me very little. I had to
have fine ladies.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> So much for the ideal; the real was
Thérèse Levasseur.</p>

<p>We are not to suppose that Rousseau’s love even when
most ideal is really exalted above the fleshly level. Byron
indeed says of Rousseau that “his was not the love of
living dame but of ideal beauty,” and if this were strictly
true Rousseau might be accounted a Platonist. But
any particular beautiful object is for Plato only a symbol
or adumbration of a supersensuous beauty; so that an
earthly love can be at best only a stepping-stone to the
Uranian Aphrodite. The terrestrial and the heavenly loves
are not in short run together, whereas the essence of
Rousseauistic love is this very blending.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> “Rousseau,”
says Joubert, “had a voluptuous mind. In his writings
the soul is always mingled with the body and never distinct
from it. No one has ever rendered more vividly the
impression of the flesh touching the spirit and the delights
of their marriage.” I need not, however, repeat here
what I have said elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> about this confusion of the
planes of being, perhaps the most important aspect of
romantic love.</p>

<p>Though Rousseau is not a true Platonist in his treatment
of love, he does, as I have said, recall at times the
cult of the mediæval knight for his lady. One may even
find in mediæval love something that is remotely related
to Rousseau’s contrast between the ideal and the actual;
for in its attitude towards woman as in other respects the
Middle Ages tended to be extreme. Woman is either depressed
below the human level as the favorite instrument
of the devil in man’s temptation (<i>mulier hominis confusio</i>),
or else exalted above this level as the mother of
God. The figure of Mary blends sense and spirit in a way
that is foreign to Plato and the ancients. As Heine says
very profanely, the Virgin was a sort of heavenly <i>dame
du comptoir</i> whose celestial smile drew the northern barbarians
into the Church. Sense was thus pressed into the
service of spirit at the risk of a perilous confusion. The
chivalric cult of the lady has obvious points of contact
with the worship of the Madonna. The knight who is
raised from one height of perfection to another by the
light of his lady’s eyes is also pressing sense into the service
of spirit with the same risk that the process may be
reversed. The reversal actually takes place in Rousseau
and his followers: spirit is pressed into the service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sense in such wise as to give to sense a sort of infinitude.
Baudelaire pays his homage to a Parisian grisette in
the form of a Latin canticle to the Virgin.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The perversion
of mediæval love is equally though not quite so
obviously present in many other Rousseauists.</p>

<p>I have said that the Middle Ages inclined to the extreme;
mediæval writers are, however, fond of insisting
on “measure”; and this is almost inevitable in view of the
large amount of classical, especially Aristotelian, survival
throughout this period. But the two distinctively mediæval
types, the saint and the knight, are neither of them
mediators. They stand, however, on an entirely different
footing as regards the law of measure. Not even Aristotle
himself would maintain that the law of measure applies
to saintliness, and in general to the religious realm. The
saint in so far as he is saintly has undergone conversion,
has in the literal sense of the word faced around and is
looking in an entirely different direction from that to
which the warnings “nothing too much” and “think as
a mortal” apply. Very different psychic elements may
indeed appear in any particular saint. A book has been
published recently on the “Romanticism of St. Francis.”
The truth seems to be that though St. Francis had his
romantic side, he was even more religious than romantic.
One may affirm with some confidence of another mediæval
figure, Peter the Hermit, that he was, on the other
hand, much more romantic than religious. For all the
information we have tends to show that he was a very
restless person and a man’s restlessness is ordinarily in
inverse ratio to his religion.</p>

<p>If the saint transcends in a way the law of measure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the knight on the other hand should be subject to it. For
courage and the love of woman&mdash;his main interests in
life&mdash;belong not to the religious but to the secular
realm. But in his conception of love and courage the
knight was plainly not a mediator but an extremist: he
was haunted by the idea of adventure, of a love and
courage that transcend the bounds not merely of the
probable but of the possible. His imagination is romantic
in the sense I have tried to define&mdash;it is straining, that is,
beyond the confines of the real. Ruskin’s violent diatribe
against Cervantes<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> for having killed “idealism” by his
ridicule of these knightly exaggerations, is in itself absurd,
but interesting as evidence of the quality of Ruskin’s own
imagination. Like other romanticists I have cited, he
seems to have been not unaware of his own kinship to
Don Quixote. The very truth about either the mediæval
or modern forms of romantic love&mdash;love which is on the
secular level and at the same time sets itself above the
law of measure&mdash;was uttered by Dr. Johnson in his comment
on the heroic plays of Dryden: “By admitting the
romantic omnipotence of love he has recommended as
laudable and worthy of imitation that conduct which
through all ages the good have censured as vicious and the
bad have despised as foolish.”</p>

<p>The man of the Middle Ages, however extravagant in
his imaginings, was often no doubt terrestrial enough in
his practice. The troubadour who addressed his high-flown
fancies to some fair châtelaine (usually a married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
woman) often had relations in real life not unlike those of
Rousseau with Thérèse Levasseur. Some such contrast
indeed between the “ideal” and the “real” existed in the
life of one of Rousseau’s favorite poets, Petrarch. The
lover may, however, run together the ideal and the
real. He may glorify some comparatively commonplace
person, crown as queen of his heart some Dulcinea del
Toboso. Hazlitt employs appropriately in describing his
own passion for the vulgar daughter of a London boarding-house
keeper the very words of Cervantes: “He had
courted a statue, hunted the wind, cried aloud to the
desert.” Hazlitt like other lovers of this type is in love not
with a particular person but with his own dream. He
is as one may say in love with love. No subject indeed
illustrates like this of love the nostalgia, the infinite indeterminate
desire of the romantic imagination. Something
of this diffusive longing no doubt came into the
world with Christianity. There is a wide gap between the
sentence of St. Augustine that Shelley has taken as epigraph
for his “Alastor”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and the spirit of the great
Greek and Roman classics. Yet such is the abiding vitality
of Greek mythology that one finds in Greece perhaps
the best symbol of the romantic lover. Rousseau could
not fail to be attracted by the story of Pygmalion and
Galatea. His lyrical “monodrama” in poetical prose,
“Pygmalion,” is important not only for its literary but
for its musical influence. The Germans in particular
(including the youthful Goethe) were fascinated. To the
mature Goethe Rousseau’s account of the sculptor who
became enamored of his own creation and breathed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
it actual life by the sheer intensity of his desire seemed a
delirious confusion of the planes of being, an attempt to
drag ideal beauty down to the level of sensuous realization.
But a passion thus conceived exactly satisfies the
romantic requirement. For though the romanticist wishes
to abandon himself to the rapture of love, he does not
wish to transcend his own ego. The object with which
Pygmalion is in love is after all only a projection of his
own “genius.” But such an object is not in any proper
sense an object at all. There is in fact no object in the
romantic universe&mdash;only subject. This subjective love
amounts in practice to a use of the imagination to enhance
emotional intoxication, or if one prefers, to the
pursuit of illusion for its own sake.</p>

<p>This lack of definite object appears just as clearly in
the German symbol of romantic love&mdash;the blue flower.
The blue flower resolves itself at last, it will be remembered,
into a fair feminine face<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>&mdash;a face that cannot,
however, be overtaken. The color typifies the blue distance
in which it always loses itself, “the never-ending
quest after the ever-fleeting object of desire.” The object
is thus elusive because, as I have said, it is not, properly
speaking, an object at all but only a dalliance of the
imagination with its own dream. Cats, says Rivarol, do
not caress us, they caress themselves upon us. But though
cats may suffer from what the new realist calls the egocentric
predicament, they can scarcely vie in the subtle
involutions of their egoism with the romantic lover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Besides creating the symbol of the blue flower, Novalis
treats romantic love in his unfinished tale “The Disciples
at Saïs.” He contemplated two endings to this tale&mdash;in
the one, when the disciple lifts the veil of the inmost
sanctuary of the temple at Saïs, Rosenblütchen (the
equivalent of the blue flower) falls into his arms. In the
second version what he sees when he lifts the mysterious
veil is&mdash;“wonder of wonders&mdash;himself.” The two endings
are in substance the same.</p>

<p>The story of Novalis’s attachment for a fourteen-year-old
girl, Sophie von Kühn, and of his plans on her death
for a truly romantic suicide&mdash;a swooning away into the
night&mdash;and then of the suddenness with which he transferred
his dream to another maiden, Julie von Charpentier,
is familiar. If Sophie had lived and Novalis had lived
and they had wedded, he might conceivably have made
her a faithful husband, but she would no longer have
been the blue flower, the ideal. For one’s love is for
something infinitely remote; it is as Shelley says, in
what is perhaps the most perfect expression of romantic
longing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The desire of the moth for the star,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of the night for the morrow,</div>
<div class="verse">The devotion to something afar</div>
<div class="verse indent1">From the sphere of our sorrow.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sphere of Shelley’s sorrow at the time he wrote these
lines to Mrs. Williams was Mary Godwin. In the time of
Harriet Westbrook, Mary had been the “star.”</p>

<p>The romantic lover often feigns in explanation of his
nostalgia that in some previous existence he had been
enamored of a nymph&mdash;an Egeria&mdash;or a woman transcending
the ordinary mould&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>“some Lilith or Helen or
Antigone.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Shelley inquires eagerly in one of his letters
about the new poem by Horace Smith, “The Nympholept.”
In the somewhat unclassical sense that the term
came to have in the romantic movement, Shelley is himself
the perfect example of the nympholept. In this respect
as in others, however, he merely continues Rousseau.
“If it had not been for some memories of my youth and
Madame d’Houdetot,” says Jean-Jacques, “the loves
that I have felt and described would have been only with
sylphids.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Chateaubriand speaks with aristocratic disdain of
Rousseau’s Venetian amours, but on the “ideal” side he
is not only his follower but perhaps the supreme French
example of nympholepsy. He describes his lady of dreams
sometimes like Rousseau as the “sylphid,” sometimes as
his “phantom of love.” He had been haunted by this
phantom almost from his childhood. “Even then I
glimpsed that to love and be loved in a way that was
unknown to me was destined to be my supreme felicity. …
As a result of the ardor of my imagination, my timidity
and solitude, I did not turn to the outer world, but
was thrown back upon myself. In the absence of a real
object, I evoked by the power of my vague desires a
phantom that was never to leave me.” To those who
remember the closely parallel passages in Rousseau,
Chateaubriand will seem to exaggerate the privilege of
the original genius to look on himself as unique when he
adds: “I do not know whether the history of the human
heart offers another example of this nature.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of this phantom of love gives the secret key to
Chateaubriand’s life. He takes refuge in the American
wilderness in order that he may have in this primitive
Arcadia a more spacious setting for his dream.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>If one wishes to see how very similar these nympholeptic
experiences are not only from individual to individual,
but from country to country, one has only to
compare the passages I have just been quoting from
Chateaubriand with Shelley’s “Epipsychidion.” Shelley
writes of his own youth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There was a Being whom my spirit oft</div>
<div class="verse">Met on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,</div>
<div class="verse">In the clear golden prime of my youth’s dawn,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,</div>
<div class="verse">Amid the enchanted mountains, and the caves</div>
<div class="verse">Of divine sleep, and on the air-like waves</div>
<div class="verse">Of wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor</div>
<div class="verse">Paved her light steps; on an imagined shore,</div>
<div class="verse">Under the gray beak of some promontory</div>
<div class="verse">She met me, robed in such exceeding glory,</div>
<div class="verse">That I beheld her not, etc.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the time of writing “Epipsychidion” the magic vision
happened to have coalesced for the moment with Emilia
Viviani, though destined soon to flit elsewhere. Shelley
invites his “soul’s sister,” the idyllic “she,” who is at
bottom only a projection of his own imagination, to set
sail with him for Arcady. “Epipsychidion,” indeed, might
be used as a manual to illustrate the difference between
mere Arcadian dreaming and a true Platonism.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand is ordinarily and rightly compared with
Byron rather than with Shelley. He is plainly, however,
far more of a nympholept than Byron. Mr. Hilary, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
in Peacock’s “Nightmare Abbey” says to Mr.
Cypress (Byron): “You talk like a Rosicrucian, who will
love nothing but a sylph, who does not believe in the existence
of a sylph, and who yet quarrels with the whole universe
for not containing a sylph.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Certain distinctions
would have to be made if one were attempting a complete
study of love in Byron; yet after all the love of Don Juan
and Haidée is one that Sappho or Catullus or Burns would
have understood; and these poets were not nympholepts.
They were capable of burning with love, but not, as
Rousseau says of himself, “without any definite object.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
Where Chateaubriand has some resemblance to
Byron is in his actual libertinism. He is however nearer
than Byron to the libertine of the eighteenth century&mdash;to
the Lovelace who pushes the pursuit of pleasure to its
final exasperation where it becomes associated with the
infliction of pain. Few things are stranger than the blend
in Chateaubriand of this Sadic fury<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> with the new
romantic revery. Indeed almost every type of egotism
that may manifest itself in the relations of the sexes and
that pushed to the superlative pitch, will be found in this
theoretical classicist and champion of Christianity. Perhaps
no more frenzied cry has ever issued from human
lips than that uttered by Atala<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> in describing her emotions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
when torn between her religious vow and her love for
Chactas: “What dream did not arise in this heart overwhelmed
with sorrow. At times in fixing my eyes upon
you, I went so far as to form desires as insensate as they
were guilty; at one moment I seemed to wish that you
and I were the only living creatures upon the earth; and
then again, feeling a divinity that held me back in my
horrible transports, I seemed to want this divinity to
be annihilated provided that clasped in your arms I
should roll from abyss to abyss with the ruins of God and
the world.” Longing is here pushed to a pitch where it
passes over, as in Wagner’s “Tristan and Isolde,” into the
desire for annihilation.</p>

<p>Actual libertinism is no necessary concomitant of
nympholeptic longing. There is a striking difference in
this respect between Poe, for example, and his translator
and disciple, Baudelaire. Nothing could be less suggestive
of voluptuousness than Poe’s nostalgia. “His ecstasy,”
says Stedman, “is that of the nympholept seeking
an evasive being of whom he has glimpses by moonlight,
starlight, even fenlight, but never by noonday.” The
embodiments of his dream that flit through his tales and
poems, enhanced his popularity with the ultra-romantic
public in France. These strange apparitions nearly all
of whom are epileptic, cataleptic, or consumptive made a
natural appeal to a school that was known among its
detractors as <i>l’école poitrinaire</i>. “Tender souls,” says
Gautier, “were specially touched by Poe’s feminine figures,
so vaporous, so transparent and of an almost spectral
beauty.” Perhaps the nympholepsy of Gérard de Nerval
is almost equally vaporous and ethereal. He pursued
through various earthly forms the queen of Sheba whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
he had loved in a previous existence and hanged himself at
last with what he believed to be her garter: an interesting
example of the relation between the extreme forms of the
romantic imagination and madness.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The pursuit of a phantom of love through various
earthly forms led in the course of the romantic movement
to certain modifications in a famous legend&mdash;that of
Don Juan. What is emphasized in the older Don Juan is
not merely his libertinism but his impiety&mdash;the gratification
of his appetite in deliberate defiance of God. He is
animated by Satanic pride, by the lust of power as well
as by the lust of sensation. In Molière’s treatment of the
legend we can also see the beginnings of the philanthropic
pose.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> With the progress of Rousseauism Don Juan tends
to become an “idealist,” to seek to satisfy in his amorous
adventures not merely his senses but his “soul” and his
thirst for the “infinite.”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Along with this idealistic Don
Juan we also see appearing at a very early stage in the
movement the exotic Don Juan who wishes to have a
great deal of strangeness added to his beauty. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
affair with the “Floridiennes,” Chateaubriand shows the
way to a long series of exotic lovers.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I said to my heart between sleeping and waking,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou wild thing that always art leaping or aching,</div>
<div class="verse">What black, brown or fair, in what clime, in what nation,</div>
<div class="verse">By turns has not taught thee a pit-a-pat-ation?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These lines are so plainly meant for Pierre Loti that one
learns with surprise that they were written about 1724
by the Earl of Peterborough.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Byron’s Don Juan is at times exotic in his tastes, but,
as I have said, he is not on the whole very nympholeptic&mdash;much
less so than the Don Juan of Alfred de Musset,
for example. Musset indeed suggests in many respects a
less masculine Byron&mdash;Mademoiselle Byron as he has
been called. In one whole side of his art as well as his
treatment of love he simply continues like Byron the
eighteenth century. But far more than Byron he aspires
to ideal and absolute passion; so that the Musset of the
“Nuits” is rightly regarded as one of the supreme embodiments,
and at the same time the chief martyr, of the
romantic religion of love. The outcome of his affair with
George Sand may symbolize fitly the wrecking of thousands
of more obscure lives by this mortal chimera.
Musset and George Sand sought to come together, yet
what they each sought in love is what the original genius
seeks in all things&mdash;self-expression. What Musset
saw in George Sand was not the real woman but only his
own dream. But George Sand was not content thus to
reflect back passively to Musset his ideal. She was rather
a Galatea whose ambition it was to create her own
Pygmalion. “Your chimera is between us,” Musset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
exclaims; but his chimera was between them too. The
more Titan and Titaness try to meet, the more each is
driven back into the solitude of his own ego. They were
in love with love rather than with one another: and to be
thus in love with love means on the last analysis to be in
love with one’s own emotions. “To love,” says Musset,
“is the great point. What matters the mistress? What
matters the flagon provided one have the intoxication?”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
He then proceeds to carry a love of this quality up into
the presence of God and to present it to him as his justification
for having lived. The art of speaking in tones of
religious consecration of what is in its essence egoistic has
never been carried further than by the Rousseauistic
romanticist. God is always appearing at the most unexpected
moments.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The highest of which man is capable
apparently is to put an uncurbed imagination into the
service of an emancipated temperament. The credo that
Perdican recites at the end of the second act of “On ne
badine pas avec l’Amour”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> throws light on this point.
Men and women according to this credo are filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
every manner of vileness, yet there is something “sacred
and sublime,” and that is the union of two of these despicable
beings.</p>

<p>The confusion of ethical values here is so palpable as
scarcely to call for comment. It is precisely when men
and women set out to love with this degree of imaginative
and emotional unrestraint that they come to deserve all
the opprobrious epithets Musset heaps upon them. This
radiant apotheosis of love and the quagmire in which it
actually lands one is, as I have said, the whole subject of
“Madame Bovary.” I shall need to return to this particular
disproportion between the ideal and the real when
I take up the subject of romantic melancholy.</p>

<p>The romantic lover who identifies the ideal with the
superlative thrill is turning the ideal into something very
transitory. If the <i>summum bonum</i> is as Browning avers
the “kiss of one girl,” the <i>summum bonum</i> is lost almost
as soon as found. The beautiful moment may however be
prolonged in revery. The romanticist may brood over it
in the tower of ivory, and when thus enriched by being
steeped in his temperament it may become more truly his
own than it was in reality. “Objects make less impression
upon me than my memory of them,” says Rousseau. He
is indeed the great master of what has been termed the
art of impassioned recollection. This art is far from being
confined in its application to love, though it may perhaps
be studied here to the best advantage. Rousseau, one
should note, had very little intellectual memory, but an
extraordinarily keen memory of images and sensations.
He could not, as he tells us in the “Confessions,” learn
anything by heart, but he could recall with perfect distinctness
what he had eaten for breakfast about thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
years before. In general he recalls his past feelings with a
clearness and detail that are perhaps more feminine than
masculine. “He seems,” says Hazlitt, one of his chief disciples
in the art of impassioned recollection, “to gather
up the past moments of his being like drops of honey-dew
to distil a precious liquor from them; his alternate pleasures
and pains are the bead-roll that he tells over and
piously worships; he makes a rosary of the flowers of hope
and fancy that strewed his earliest years.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> This highly
developed emotional memory is closely associated with
the special quality of the romantic imagination&mdash;its
cult of Arcadian illusion and the wistful backward glance
to the vanished paradise of childhood and youth when
illusion was most spontaneous. “Let me still recall [these
memories],” says Hazlitt, “that they may breathe fresh
life into me, and that I may live that birthday of thought
and romantic pleasure over again! Talk of the ideal! This
is the only true ideal&mdash;the heavenly tints of Fancy reflected
in the bubbles that float upon the spring-tide of
human life.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Hazlitt converts criticism itself into an art
of impassioned recollection. He loves to linger over the
beautiful moments of his own literary life. The passing
years have increased the richness of their temperamental
refraction and bestowed upon them the “pathos of distance.”
A good example is his account of the two years of
his youth he spent in reading the “Confessions” and the
“Nouvelle Héloïse,” and in shedding tears over them.
“They were the happiest years of our life. We may well
say of them, sweet is the dew of their memory and pleasant
the balm of their recollection.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Rousseau’s own Arcadian memories are usually not of
reading, like Hazlitt’s, but of actual incidents, though he
does not hesitate to alter these incidents freely, as in his
account of his stay at Les Charmettes, and to accommodate
them to his dream. He neglected the real Madame de
Warens at the very time that he cherished his recollection
of her because this recollection was the idealized image
of his own youth. The yearning that he expresses at the
beginning of his fragmentary Tenth Promenade, written
only a few weeks before his death, is for this idyllic period
rather than for an actual woman.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> A happy memory, says
Musset, repeating Rousseau, is perhaps more genuine
than happiness itself. Possibly the three best known love
poems of Lamartine, Musset, and Hugo respectively&mdash;“Le
Lac,” “Souvenir,” and “La Tristesse d’Olympio,”
all hinge upon impassioned recollection and derive very
directly from Rousseau. Lamartine in particular has
caught in the “Le Lac” the very cadence of Rousseau’s
reveries.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Impassioned recollection may evidently be an abundant
source of genuine poetry, though not, it must be
insisted, of the highest poetry. The predominant rôle that
it plays in Rousseau and many of his followers is simply
a sign of an unduly dalliant imagination. Experience after
all has other uses than to supply furnishings for the tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of ivory; it should control the judgment and guide the
will; it is in short the necessary basis of conduct. The
greater a man’s moral seriousness, the more he will be
concerned with doing rather than dreaming (and I include
right meditation among the forms of doing). He
will also demand an art and literature that reflect this
his main preoccupation. Between Wordsworth’s definition
of poetry as “emotion recollected in tranquillity,”
and Aristotle’s definition of poetry as the imitation of
human action according to probability or necessity, a wide
gap plainly opens. One may prefer Aristotle’s definition
to that of Wordsworth and yet do justice to the merits of
Wordsworth’s actual poetical performance. Nevertheless
the tendency to put prime emphasis on feeling instead of
action shown in the definition is closely related to Wordsworth’s
failure not only in dramatic but in epic poetry, in
all poetry in short that depends for its success on an element
of plot and sustained narrative.</p>

<p>A curious extension of the art of impassioned recollection
should receive at least passing mention. It has been
so extended as to lead to what one may term an unethical
use of literature and history. What men have done in the
past and the consequences of this doing should surely
serve to throw some light on what men should do under
similar circumstances in the present. But the man who
turns his own personal experience into mere dalliance
may very well assume a like dalliant attitude towards the
larger experience of the race. This experience may merely
provide him with pretexts for revery. This narcotic use of
literature and history, this art of creating for one’s self an
alibi as Taine calls it, is nearly as old as the romantic
movement. The record of the past becomes a gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
pageant that lures one to endless imaginative exploration
and lulls one to oblivion of everything except its variety
and picturesqueness. It becomes everything in fact except
a school of judgment. One may note in connection
with this use of history the usual interplay between
scientific and emotional naturalism. Both forms of naturalism
tend to turn man into the mere product and plaything
of physical forces&mdash;climate, heredity, and the like,
over which his will has no control. Since literature and
history have no meaning from the point of view of moral
choice they may at least be made to yield the maximum
of æsthetic satisfaction. Oscar Wilde argues in this wise
for example in his dialogue “The Critic as Artist,” and
concludes that since man has no moral freedom or responsibility,
and cannot therefore be guided in his conduct
by the past experience of the race, he may at least
turn this experience into an incomparable “bower of
dreams.” “The pain of Leopardi crying out against life
becomes our pain. Theocritus blows on his pipe and we
laugh with the lips of nymph and shepherd. In the wolf-skin
of Pierre Vidal we flee before the hounds, and in the
armor of Lancelot we ride from the bower of the queen.
We have whispered the secret of our love beneath the
cowl of Abelard, and in the stained raiment of Villon have
put our shame into song,” etc.</p>

<p>The assumption that runs through this passage that
the mere æsthetic contemplation of past experience gives
the equivalent of actual experience is found in writers of
far higher standing than Wilde&mdash;in Renan, for instance.
The æsthete would look on his dream as a substitute for
the actual, and at the same time convert the actual into
a dream. (<i>Die Welt wird Traum, der Traum wird Welt.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
It is not easy to take such a programme of universal
dreaming seriously. In the long run the dreamer himself
does not find it easy to take it seriously. For his attempts
to live his chimera result, as we have seen in the case of
romantic love, in more or less disastrous defeat and disillusion.
The disillusioned romanticist continues to cling
to his dream, but intellectually, at least, he often comes at
the same time to stand aloof from it. This subject of
disillusion may best be considered, along with certain
other important aspects of the movement, in connection
with the singular phenomenon known as romantic irony.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">ROMANTIC IRONY</span></h2>

<p>The first romanticist who worked out a theory of irony
was Friedrich Schlegel.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The attempt to put this theory
into practice, after the fashion of Tieck’s plays, seemed
and seemed rightly even to later representatives of the
movement to be extravagant. Thus Hegel, who in his
ideas on art continues in so many respects the Schlegels,
repudiates irony. Formerly, says Heine, who is himself in
any larger survey, the chief of German romantic ironists,
when a man had said a stupid thing he had said it; now
he can explain it away as “irony.” Nevertheless one cannot
afford to neglect this early German theory. It derives
in an interesting way from the views that the partisans of
original genius had put forth regarding the rôle of the creative
imagination. The imagination as we have seen is to
be free to wander wild in its own empire of chimeras.
Rousseau showed the possibilities of an imagination that
is at once extraordinarily rich and also perfectly free in
this sense. I have said that Kant believed like the original
genius that the nobility of art depends on the free “play”
of the imagination; though he adds that art should at the
same time submit to a purpose that is not a purpose&mdash;whatever
that may mean. Schiller in his “Æsthetic Letters”
relaxed the rationalistic rigor of Kant in favor of
feeling and associated even more emphatically the ideality
and creativeness of art with its free imaginative play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
its emancipation from specific aim. The personal friction
that arose between the Schlegels and Schiller has perhaps
obscured somewhat their general indebtedness to him.
The Schlegelian irony in particular merely pushes to an
extreme the doctrine that nothing must interfere with
the imagination in its creative play. “The caprice of the
poet,” as Friedrich Schlegel says, “suffers no law above
itself.” Why indeed should the poet allow any restriction
to be placed upon his caprice in a universe that is after
all only a projection of himself? The play theory of art is
here supplemented by the philosophy of Fichte.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> In justice
to him it should be said that though his philosophy
may not rise above the level of temperament, he at least
had a severe and stoical temperament, and if only for this
reason his “transcendental ego” is far less obviously
ego than that which appears in the irony of his romantic
followers. When a man has taken possession of his transcendental
ego, according to the Schlegels and Novalis,
he looks down on his ordinary ego and stands aloof from
it. His ordinary ego may achieve poetry but his transcendental
ego must achieve the poetry of poetry. But
there is in him something that may stand aloof even from
this aloofness and so on indefinitely. Romantic irony joins
here with what is perhaps the chief preoccupation of the
German romanticists, the idea of the infinite or, as they
term it, the striving for endlessness (<i>Unendlichkeitstreben</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Now, according to the romanticist, a man can show that
he lays hold imaginatively upon the infinite only by
expanding beyond what his age holds to be normal and
central&mdash;its conventions in short; nay more, he must
expand away from any centre he has himself achieved.
For to hold fast to a centre of any kind implies the acceptance
of limitations and to accept limitations is to be finite,
and to be finite is, as Blake says, to become mechanical;
and the whole of romanticism is a protest against the
mechanizing of life. No man therefore deserves to rank as
a transcendental egotist unless he has learned to mock not
merely at the convictions of others but at his own, unless
he has become capable of self-parody. “Objection,” says
Nietzsche, “evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony
are signs of health; everything absolute belongs to
pathology.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>One cannot repeat too often that what the romanticist
always sees at the centre is either the mere rationalist or
else the philistine; and he therefore inclines to measure
his own distinction by his remoteness from any possible
centre. Now thus to be always moving away from centrality
is to be paradoxical, and romantic irony is, as
Friedrich Schlegel says, identical with paradox. Irony,
paradox and the idea of the infinite have as a matter of
fact so many points of contact in romanticism that they
may profitably be treated together.</p>

<p>Friedrich Schlegel sought illustrious sponsors in the
past for his theory of irony. Among others he invoked the
Greeks and put himself in particular under the patronage
of Socrates. But Greek irony always had a centre.
The ironical contrast is between this centre and something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that is less central. Take for example the so-called irony
of Greek tragedy. The tragic character speaks and acts
in darkness as to his impending doom, regarding which
the spectator is comparatively enlightened. To take another
example, the German romanticists were especially
absurd in their attempts to set up Tieck as a new Aristophanes.
For Aristophanes, however wild and irresponsible
he may seem in the play of his imagination, never
quite loses sight of his centre, a centre from which the
comic spirit proceeds and to which it returns. Above all,
however far he may push his mockery, he never mocks at
his own convictions; he never, like Tieck, indulges in
self-parody. A glance at the parabasis of almost any one
of his plays will suffice to show that he was willing to lay
himself open to the charge of being unduly didactic
rather than to the charge of being aimless. The universe
of Tieck, on the other hand, is a truly romantic universe:
it has no centre, or what amounts to the same thing, it
has at its centre that symbol of spiritual stagnation, the
philistine, and his inability to rise above a dull didacticism.
The romanticist cherishes the illusion that to be a
spiritual vagrant is to be exalted on a pinnacle above the
plain citizen. According to Professor Stuart P. Sherman,
the Irish dramatist Synge indulges in gypsy laughter
from the bushes,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> a good description of romantic irony
in general.</p>

<p>The irony of Socrates, to take the most important
example of Greek irony, is not of the centrifugal character.
Socrates professes ignorance, and this profession
seems very ironical, for it turns out that his ignorance is
more enlightened, that is, more central than other me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>n’s
swelling conceit of knowledge. It does not follow that
Socrates is insincere in his profession of ignorance; for
though his knowledge may be as light in comparison
with that of the ordinary Athenian, he sees that in comparison
with true and perfect knowledge it is only darkness.
For Socrates was no mere rationalist; he was a man
of insight, one would even be tempted to say a mystic
were it not for the corruption of the term mystic by the
romanticists. This being the case he saw that man is by
his very nature precluded from true and perfect knowledge.
A path, however, opens up before him towards
this knowledge, and this path he should seek to follow
even though it is in a sense endless, even though beyond
any centre he can attain within the bounds of his finite
experience there is destined always to be something still
more central. Towards the mere dogmatist, the man who
thinks he has achieved some fixed and final centre, the
attitude of Socrates is that of scepticism. This attitude
implies a certain degree of detachment from the received
beliefs and conventions of his time, and it is all the more
important to distinguish here between Socrates and the
romanticists because of the superficial likeness; and also
because there is between the Rousseauists and some of
the Greeks who lived about the time of Socrates a real
likeness. Promethean individualism was already rife at
that time, and on the negative side it resulted then as
since in a break with tradition, and on the positive side
in an oscillation between the cult of force and the exaltation
of sympathy, between admiration for the strong man
and compassion for the weak. It is hardly possible to
overlook these Promethean elements in the plays of
Euripides. Antisthenes and the cynics, again, who professed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to derive from Socrates, established an opposition
between “nature” and convention even more radical in
some respects than that established by Rousseau. Moreover
Socrates himself was perhaps needlessly unconventional
and also unduly inclined to paradox&mdash;as when
he suggested to the jury who tried him that as an appropriate
punishment he should be supported at the public
expense in the prytaneum. Yet in his inner spirit and in
spite of certain minor eccentricities, Socrates was neither
a superman nor a Bohemian, but a humanist. Now that
the critical spirit was abroad and the traditional basis
for conduct was failing, he was chiefly concerned with
putting conduct on a positive and critical basis. In establishing
this basis his constant appeal is to actual experience
and the more homely this experience the more it
seems to please him. While working out the new basis for
conduct he continues to observe the existing laws and
customs; or if he gets away from the traditional discipline
it is towards a stricter discipline; if he repudiates in aught
the common sense of his day, it is in favor of a commoner
sense. One may say indeed that Socrates and the Rousseauists
(who are in this respect like some of the sophists)
are both moving away from convention but in opposite
directions. What the romanticist opposes to convention
is his “genius,” that is his unique and private self. What
Socrates opposes to convention is his universal and ethical
self. According to Friedrich Schlegel, a man can never
be a philosopher but only become one; if at any time he
thinks that he is a philosopher he ceases to become one.
The romanticist is right in thus thinking that to remain
fixed at any particular point is to stagnate. Man is, as
Nietzsche says, the being who must always surpass himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
but he has&mdash;and this is a point that Nietzsche did
not sufficiently consider&mdash;a choice of direction in his
everlasting pilgrimage. The man who is moving away
from some particular centre will always seem paradoxical
to the man who remains at it, but he may be moving
away from it in either the romantic or the ethical direction.
In the first case he is moving from a more normal
to a less normal experience, in the second case he is moving
towards an experience that is more profoundly representative.
The New Testament abounds in examples of
the ethical paradox&mdash;what one may term the paradox of
humility. (A man must lose his life to find it, etc.) It is
possible, however, to push even this type of paradox too
far, to push it to a point where it affronts not merely some
particular convention but the good sense of mankind
itself, and this is a far graver matter. Pascal falls into this
excess when he says that sickness is the natural state of
the Christian. As a result of its supreme emphasis on
humility Christianity from the start inclined unduly perhaps
towards this type of paradox. It is hardly worth
while, as Goethe said, to live seventy years in this world
if all that one learn here below is only folly in the sight of
God.</p>

<p>One of the most delicate of tasks is to determine
whether a paradox occupies a position more or less central
than the convention to which it is opposed. A somewhat
similar problem is to determine which of two differing
conventions has the greater degree of centrality. For one
convention may as compared with another seem highly
paradoxical. In 1870, it was announced at Peking that his
Majesty the Emperor had had the good fortune to catch
the small-pox. The auspiciousness of small-pox was part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of the Chinese convention at this time, but to those of us
who live under another convention it is a blessing we
would willingly forego. But much in the Chinese convention,
so far from being absurd, reflects the Confucian
good sense, and if the Chinese decide to break with their
convention, they should evidently consider long and
carefully in which direction they are going to move&mdash;whether
towards something more central, or something
more eccentric.</p>

<p>As to the direction in which Rousseau is moving and
therefore as to the quality of his paradoxes there can be
little question. His paradoxes&mdash;and he is perhaps the
most paradoxical of writers&mdash;reduce themselves on
analysis to the notion that man has suffered a loss of
goodness by being civilized, by having had imposed on
his unconscious and instinctive self some humanistic or
religious discipline&mdash;e.g., “The man who reflects is a
depraved animal”; “True Christians are meant to be
slaves”; decorum is only the “varnish of vice” or the
“mask of hypocrisy.” Innumerable paradoxes of this
kind will immediately occur to one as characteristic of
Rousseau and his followers. These paradoxes may be
termed in opposition to those of humility, the paradoxes
of spontaneity. The man who holds them is plainly moving
in an opposite direction not merely from the Christian
but from the Socratic individualist. He is moving from
the more representative to the less representative and not
towards some deeper centre of experience, as would be the
case if he were tending towards either humanism or religion.
Wordsworth has been widely accepted not merely
as a poet but as a religious teacher, and it is therefore
important to note that his paradoxes are prevailingly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the Rousseauistic type. His verse is never more spontaneous
or, as he would say, inevitable, than when it is
celebrating the gospel of spontaneity. I have already
pointed out some of the paradoxes that he opposes to
pseudo-classic decorum: e.g., his attempt to bestow
poetical dignity and importance upon the ass, and to
make of it a model of moral excellence, also to find poetry
in an idiot boy and to associate sublimity with a pedlar in
defiance of the ordinary character of pedlars. In general
Wordsworth indulges in Rousseauistic paradoxes when
he urges us to look to peasants for the true language
of poetry and would have us believe that man is taught
by “woods and rills” and not by contact with his fellow
men. He pushes this latter paradox to a point that would
have made even Rousseau “stare and gasp” when he
asserts that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">One impulse from a vernal wood</div>
<div class="verse">May teach you more of man</div>
<div class="verse">Of moral evil and of good</div>
<div class="verse">Than all the sages can.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another form of this same paradox that what comes
from nature spontaneously is better than what can be
acquired by conscious effort is found in his poem “Lucy
Gray”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;</div>
<div class="verse">She dwelt on a wide moor,</div>
<div class="verse">The sweetest thing that ever grew</div>
<div class="verse">Beside a human door!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>True maidenhood is made up of a thousand decorums;
but this Rousseauistic maiden would have seemed too
artificial if she had been reared in a house instead of
“growing” out of doors; she might in that case have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a human being and not a “thing” and this would plainly
have detracted from her spontaneity. Wordsworth’s
paradoxes about children have a similar origin. A child
who at the age of six is a “mighty prophet, seer blest,”
is a highly improbable not to say impossible child. The
“Nature” again of “Heart-Leap Well” which both feels
and inspires pity is more remote from normal experience
than the Nature “red in tooth and claw” of Tennyson.
Wordsworth indeed would seem to have a penchant for
paradox even when he is less obviously inspired by his
naturalistic thesis.</p>

<p>A study of Wordsworth’s life shows that he became
progressively disillusioned regarding Rousseauistic spontaneity.
He became less paradoxical as he grew older and
in almost the same measure, one is tempted to say, less
poetical. He returns gradually to the traditional forms
until radicals come to look upon him as the “lost leader.”
He finds it hard, however, to wean his imagination from
its primitivistic Arcadias; so that what one finds, in
writing like the “Ecclesiastical Sonnets,” is not imaginative
fire but at best a sober intellectual conviction, an
opposition between the head and the heart in short that
suggests somewhat Chateaubriand and the “Genius of
Christianity.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> If Wordsworth had lost faith in his revolutionary
and naturalistic ideal, and had at the same time
refused to return to the traditional forms, one might then
have seen in his work something of the homeless hovering
of the romantic ironist. If, on the other hand, he had
worked away from the centre that the traditional forms
give to life towards a more positive and critical centre, if,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in other words, he had broken with the past not on Rousseauistic,
but on Socratic lines, he would have needed
an imagination of different quality, an imagination less
idyllic and pastoral and more ethical than that he usually
displays.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> For the ethical imagination alone can guide
one not indeed to any fixed centre but to an ever increasing
centrality. We are here confronted once more with the
question of the infinite which comes very close to the
ultimate ground of difference between classicist and romanticist.
The centre that one perceives with the aid of
the classical imagination and that sets bounds to impulse
and desire may, as I have already said, be defined in
opposition to the outer infinite of expansion as the inner
or human infinite. If we moderns, to repeat Nietzsche, are
unable to attain proportionateness it is because “our
itching is really the itching for the infinite, the immeasurable.”
Thus to associate the infinite only with the immeasurable,
to fail to perceive that the element of form
and the curb it puts on the imagination are not external
and artificial, but come from the very depths, is to betray
the fact that one is a barbarian. Nietzsche and many
other romanticists are capable on occasion of admiring
the proportionateness that comes from allegiance to some
centre. But after all the human spirit must be ever advancing,
and its only motive powers, according to romantic
logic, are wonder and curiosity; and so from the perfectly
sound premise that man is the being who must always
surpass himself, Nietzsche draws the perfectly unsound
conclusion that the only way for man thus constantly to
surpass himself and so show his infinitude is to spurn all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
limits and “live dangerously.” The Greeks themselves,
according to Renan, will some day seem the “apostles of
ennui,” for the very perfection of their form shows a lack
of aspiration. To submit to form is to be static, whereas
“romantic poetry,” says Friedrich Schlegel magnificently,
is “universal progressive poetry.” Now the only
effective counterpoise to the endless expansiveness that
is implied in such a programme is the inner or human
infinite of concentration. For it is perfectly true that
there is something in man that is not satisfied with the
finite and that, if he becomes stationary, he is at once
haunted by the spectre of ennui. Man may indeed be
defined as the insatiable animal; and the more imaginative
he is the more insatiable he is likely to become, for it is
the imagination that gives him access to the infinite in
every sense of the word. In a way Baudelaire is right when
he describes ennui as a “delicate monster” that selects
as his prey the most highly gifted natures. Marguerite
d’Angoulême already speaks of the “ennui proper to
well-born spirits.” Now religion seeks no less than
romance an escape from ennui. Bossuet is at one with
Baudelaire when he dilates on that “inexorable ennui
which is the very substance of human life.” But Bossuet
and Baudelaire differ utterly in the remedies they propose
for ennui. Baudelaire hopes to escape from ennui by
dreaming of the superlative emotional adventure, by
indulging in infinite, indeterminate desire, and becomes
more and more restless in his quest for a something that
at the end always eludes him. This infinite of nostalgia
has nothing in common with the infinite of religion. No
distinction is more important than that between the man
who feels the divine discontent of religion, and the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
who is suffering from mere romantic restlessness. According
to religion man must seek the satisfaction that the
finite fails to give by looking not without but within;
and to look within he must in the literal sense of the word
undergo conversion. A path will then be found to open up
before him, a path of which he cannot see the end. He
merely knows that to advance on this path is to increase
in peace, poise, centrality; though beyond any calm he
can attain is always a deeper centre of calm. The goal is
at an infinite remove. This is the truth that St. Augustine
puts theologically when he exclaims: “For thou hast
made us for thyself and our heart is restless until it
findeth peace in thee.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> One should insist that this
question of the two infinites is not abstract and metaphysical
but bears on what is most concrete and immediate
in experience. If the inner and human infinite
cannot be formulated intellectually, it can be known practically
in its effect on life and conduct. Goethe says of
Werther that he “treated his heart like a sick child; its
every wish was granted it.” “My restless heart asked me
for something else,” says Rousseau. “René,” says Chateaubriand,
“was enchanted, tormented and, as it were,
possessed by the demon of his heart.” Mr. Galsworthy
speaks in a similar vein of “the aching for the wild, the
passionate, the new, that never quite dies in a man’s
heart.” But is there not deep down in the human breast
another heart that is felt as a power of control over this
romantic heart and can keep within due bounds “its
aching for the wild, the passionate, the new.” This is the
heart, it would seem, to which a man must hearken if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
is not for a “little honey of romance” to abandon his
“ancient wisdom and austere control.”</p>

<p>The romantic corruption of the infinite here joins with
the romantic corruption of conscience, the transformation
of conscience from an inner check into an expansive emotion
that I have already traced in Shaftesbury and Rousseau.
But one should add that in some of its aspects this
corruption of the idea of the infinite antedates the whole
modern movement. At least the beginnings of it can be
found in ancient Greece,&mdash;especially in that “delirious
and diseased Greece” of which Joubert speaks&mdash;the
Greece of the neo-Platonists. There is already in the neo-Platonic
notion of the infinite a strong element of expansiveness.
Aristotle and the older Greeks conceived of the
infinite in this sense as bad. That something in human
nature which is always reaching out for more&mdash;whether
the more of sensation or of power or of knowledge&mdash;was,
they held, to be strictly reined in and disciplined to the
law of measure. All the furies lie in wait for the man who
overextends himself. He is ripening for Nemesis. “Nothing
too much.” “Think as a mortal.” “The half is better
than the whole.” In his attitude towards man’s expansive
self the Greek as a rule stands for mediation, and not
like the more austere Christian, for renunciation. Yet
Plato frequently and Aristotle at times mount from
the humanistic to the religious level. One of the most
impressive passages in philosophy is that in which Aristotle,
perhaps the chief exponent of the law of measure,
affirms that one who has really faced about and is moving
towards the inner infinite needs no warning against excess:
“We should not give heed,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> “to those who bid
one think as a mortal, but so far as we can we should make
ourselves immortal and do all with a view to a life in
accord with the best Principle in us.”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> (This Principle
Aristotle goes on to say is a man’s true self.)</p>

<p>The earlier Greek distinction between an outer and
evil infinite of expansive desire and an inner infinite that
is raised above the flux and yet rules it, is, in the Aristotelian
phrase, its “unmoved mover,” became blurred, as
I have said, during the Alexandrian period. The Alexandrian
influence entered to some extent into Christianity
itself and filtered through various channels down to
modern times. Some of the romanticists went directly to
the neo-Platonists, especially Plotinus. Still more were
affected by Jacob Boehme, who himself had no direct
knowledge of the Alexandrian theosophy. This theosophy
appears nevertheless in combination with other elements
in his writings. He appealed to the new school by his insistence
on the element of appetency or desire, by his universal
symbolizing, above all by his tendency to make of
the divine an affirmative instead of a restrictive force&mdash;a
something that pushes forward instead of holding back.
The expansive elements are moderated in Boehme himself
and in disciples like Law by genuinely religious elements&mdash;e.g.,
humility and the idea of conversion. What happens
when the expansiveness is divorced from these elements,
one may see in another English follower of Boehme&mdash;William
Blake. To be both beautiful and wise one
needs, according to Blake, only to be exuberant. The influence
of Boehme blends in Blake with the new æstheticism.
Jesus himself, he says, so far from being restrained
“was all virtue, and acted from impulse not from rules.”
This purely æsthetic and impulsive Jesus has been cruelly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
maligned, as we learn from the poem entitled the “Everlasting
Gospel,” by being represented as humble and
chaste. Religion itself thus becomes in Blake the mere
sport of a powerful and uncontrolled imagination, and this
we are told is mysticism. I have already contrasted with
this type of mysticism something that goes under the same
name and is yet utterly different&mdash;the mysticism of
ancient India. Instead of conceiving of the divine in
terms of expansion the Oriental sage defines it experimentally
as the “inner check.” No more fundamental
distinction perhaps can be made than that between those
who associate the good with the yes-principle and those
who associate it rather with the no-principle. But I need
not repeat what I have said elsewhere on the romantic
attempt to discredit the veto power. Let no one think
that this contrast is merely metaphysical. The whole
problem of evil is involved in it and all the innumerable
practical consequences that follow from one’s attitude
towards this problem. The passage in which Faust defines
the devil as the “spirit that always says no” would seem
to derive directly or indirectly from Boehme. According
to Boehme good can be known only through evil. God
therefore divides his will into two, the “yes” and the
“no,” and so founds an eternal contrast to himself in order
to enter into a struggle with it, and finally to discipline
and assimilate it. The object of all manifested nature is
the transforming of the will which says “no” into the will
which says “yes.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The opposition between good and
evil tends to lose its reality when it thus becomes a sort
of sham battle that God gets up with himself (without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
contraries is no progression, says Blake), or when, to
take the form that the doctrine assumes in “Faust,” the
devil appears as the necessary though unwilling instrument
of man’s betterment. The recoil from the doctrine
of total depravity was perhaps inevitable. What is sinister
is that advantage has been taken of this recoil to tamper
with the problem of evil itself. Partial evil we are told is
universal good; or else evil is only good in the making.
For a Rousseau or a Shelley it is something mysteriously
imposed from without on a spotless human nature; for
a Wordsworth it is something one may escape by contemplating
the speargrass on the wall.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> For a Novalis
sin is a mere illusion of which a man should rid his mind
if he aspires to become a “magic idealist.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> In spite of his
quaint Tory prejudices Dr. Johnson is one of the few
persons in recent times that one may term wise without
serious qualification because he never dodges or equivocates
in dealing with the problem of evil; he never fades
away from the fact of evil into some theosophic or sentimental
dream.</p>

<p>The rise of a purely expansive view of life in the eighteenth
century was marked by a great revival of enthusiasm.
The chief grievance of the expansionist indeed
against the no-principle is that it kills enthusiasm. But
concentration no less than expansion may have its own
type of enthusiasm. It is therefore imperative in an age
that has repudiated the traditional sanctions and set out
to walk by the inner light that all general terms and in
particular the term enthusiasm should be protected by a
powerful dialectic. Nothing is more perilous than an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
uncritical enthusiasm, since it is only by criticism that
one may determine whether the enthusiast is a man who
is moving towards wisdom or is a candidate for Bedlam.
The Rousseauist, however, exalts enthusiasm at the same
time that he depreciates discrimination. “Enthusiasm,”
says Emerson, “is the height of man. It is the passage
from the human to the divine.” It is only too characteristic
of Emerson and of the whole school to which he
belongs, to put forth statements of this kind without any
dialectical protection. The type of enthusiasm to which
Emerson’s praise might be properly applied, the type
that has been defined as exalted peace, though extremely
rare, actually exists. A commoner type of enthusiasm
during the past century is that which has been defined as
“the rapturous disintegration of civilized human nature.”
When we have got our fingers well burned as a result of
our failure to make the necessary discriminations, we
may fly to the opposite extreme like the men of the early
eighteenth century among whom, as is well known, enthusiasm
had become a term of vituperation. This dislike of
enthusiasm was the natural recoil from the uncritical following
of the inner light by the fanatics of the seventeenth
century. Shaftesbury attacks this older type of enthusiasm
and at the same time prepares the way for the new
emotional enthusiasm. One cannot say, however, that
any such sharp separation of types appears in the revival
of enthusiasm that begins about the middle of the eighteenth
century, though some of those who were working
for this revival felt the need of discriminating:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">That which concerns us therefore is to see</div>
<div class="verse">What Species of Enthusiasts we be&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>says John Byrom in his poem on Enthusiasm. The different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
species, however,&mdash;the enthusiasm of the Evangelicals
and Wesleyans, the enthusiasm of those who like
Law and his disciple Byrom hearken back to Boehme,
the enthusiasm of Rousseau and the sentimentalists,
tend to run together. To “let one’s feelings run in soft
luxurious flow,”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> is, as Newman says, at the opposite pole
from spirituality. Yet much of this mere emotional facility
appears alongside of genuinely religious elements in
the enthusiasm of the Methodist. One may get a notion
of the jumble to which I refer by reading a book like
Henry Brooke’s “Fool of Quality.” Brooke is at one and
the same time a disciple of Boehme and Rousseau
while being more or less affiliated with the Methodistic
movement. The book indeed was revised and abridged
by John Wesley himself and in this form had a wide circulation
among his followers.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The enthusiasm that has marked the modern movement
has plainly not been sufficiently critical. Perhaps
the first discovery that any one will make who wishes
to be at once critical and enthusiastic is that in a genuinely
spiritual enthusiasm the inner light and the inner
check are practically identical. He will find that if he is
to rise above the naturalistic level he must curb constantly
his expansive desires with reference to some centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
that is set above the flux. Here let me repeat is the supreme
rôle of the imagination. The man who has ceased to lean
on outer standards can perceive his new standards or
centre of control only through its aid. I have tried to
show that to aim at such a centre is not to be stagnant
and stationary but on the contrary to be at once purposeful
and progressive. To assert that the creativeness
of the imagination is incompatible with centrality or,
what amounts to the same thing, with purpose, is to
assert that the creativeness of the imagination is incompatible
with reality or at least such reality as man
may attain. Life is at best a series of illusions; the whole
office of philosophy is to keep it from degenerating into
a series of delusions. If we are to keep it from thus degenerating
we need to grasp above all the difference
between the eccentric and the concentric imagination.
To look for serious guidance to an imagination that owes
allegiance to nothing above itself, is to run the risk of
taking some cloud bank for terra firma. The eccentric
imagination may give access to the “infinite,” but it is
an infinite empty of content and therefore an infinite not
of peace but of restlessness. Can any one maintain seriously
that there is aught in common between the “striving
for endlessness” of the German romanticists and the
supreme and perfect Centre that Dante glimpses at the
end of the “Divine Comedy” and in the presence of
which he becomes dumb?</p>

<p>We are told to follow the gleam, but the counsel is
somewhat ambiguous. The gleam that one follows may be
that which is associated with the concentric imagination
and which gives steadiness and informing purpose, or it
may be the romantic will o’ the wisp. One may, as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
said, in recreative moments allow one’s imagination to
wander without control, but to take these wanderings
seriously is to engage in a sort of endless pilgrimage in
the void. The romanticist is constantly yielding to the
“spell” of this or the “lure” of that, or the “call” of
some other thing. But when the wonder and strangeness
that he is chasing are overtaken, they at once cease to
be wondrous and strange, while the gleam is already
dancing over some other object on the distant horizon.
For nothing is in itself romantic, it is only imagining that
makes it so. Romanticism is the pursuit of the element of
illusion in things for its own sake; it is in short the cherishing
of glamour. The word glamour introduced into
literary usage from popular Scotch usage by Walter
Scott itself illustrates this tendency. Traced etymologically,
it turns out to be the same word as grammar. In
an illiterate age to know how to write at all was a weird
and magical accomplishment,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> but in an educated age,
nothing is so drearily unromantic, so lacking in glamour
as grammar.</p>

<p>The final question that arises in connection with this
subject is whether one may quell the mere restlessness of
one’s spirit and impose upon it an ethical purpose. “The
man who has no definite end is lost,” says Montaigne.
The upshot of the romantic supposition that purpose
is incompatible with the freedom of the imagination is
a philosophy like that of Nietzsche. He can conceive of
nothing beyond whirling forever on the wheel of change
(“the eternal recurrence”) without any goal or firm
refuge that is set above the flux. He could not help doubting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
at times whether happiness was to be found after all
in mere endless, purposeless mutation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

</div>

<p>To allow one’s self to revolve passively on the wheel of
change (<i>samsāra</i>) seemed to the Oriental sage the acme
of evil. An old Hindu writer compares the man who does
not impose a firm purpose upon the manifold solicitations
of sense to a charioteer who fails to rein in his restless
steeds<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>&mdash;a comparison suggested independently to
Ricarda Huch by the lives of the German romanticists.
In the absence of central control, the parts of the self
tend to pull each in a different way. It is not surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
that in so centrifugal a movement, at least on the human
and spiritual level, one should find so many instances of
disintegrated and multiple personality. The fascination
that the phenomenon of the double (<i>Doppelgängerei</i>) had
for Hoffmann and other German romanticists is well
known.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> It may well be that some such disintegration of
the self takes place under extreme emotional stress.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
We should not fail to note here the usual coöperation
between the emotional and the scientific naturalist. Like
the romanticist, the scientific psychologist is more interested
in the abnormal than in the normal. According to
the Freudians, the personality that has become incapable
of any conscious aim is not left entirely rudderless. The
guidance that it is unable to give itself is supplied to it
by some “wish,” usually obscene, from the sub-conscious
realm of dreams. The Freudian then proceeds to develop
what may be true of the hysterical degenerate into a complete
view of life.</p>

<p>Man is in danger of being deprived of every last scrap
and vestige of his humanity by this working together of
romanticism and science. For man becomes human only
in so far as he exercises moral choice. He must also enter
upon the pathway of ethical purpose if he is to achieve
happiness. “Moods,” says Novalis, “undefined emotions,
not defined emotions and feelings, give happiness.” The
experience of life shows so plainly that this is not so that
the romanticist is tempted to seek shelter once more from
his mere vagrancy of spirit in the outer discipline he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
abandoned. “To such unsettled ones as thou, seemeth at
last even a prisoner blessed. Didst thou ever see how
captured criminals sleep? They sleep quietly, they enjoy
their new security. … Beware in the end lest a narrow
faith capture thee, a hard rigorous delusion! For now
everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth and tempteth
thee.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Various reasons have been given for romantic conversions
to Catholicism&mdash;for example, the desire for confession
(though the Catholic does not, like the Rousseauist,
confess himself from the housetops), the æsthetic
appeal of Catholic rites and ceremonies, etc. The sentence
of Nietzsche puts us on the track of still another reason.
The affinity of certain romantic converts for the Church
is that of the jelly-fish for the rock. It is appropriate that
Friedrich Schlegel, the great apostle of irony, should
after a career as a heaven-storming Titan end by submitting
to this most rigid of all forms of outer authority.</p>

<p>For it should now be possible to return after our digression
on paradox and the idea of the infinite and the perils
of aimlessness, to romantic irony with a truer understanding
of its significance. Like so much else in this movement
it is an attempt to give to a grave psychic weakness the
prestige of strength&mdash;unless indeed one conceives the
superior personality to be the one that lacks a centre and
principle of control. Man it has usually been held should
think lightly of himself but should have some conviction
for which he is ready to die. The romantic ironist, on the
other hand, is often morbidly sensitive about himself, but
is ready to mock at his own convictions. Rousseau was
no romantic ironist, but the root of self-parody is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
nevertheless in his saying that his heart and his head did
not seem to belong to the same individual. Everything of
course is a matter of degree. What poor mortal can say
that he is perfectly at one with himself? Friedrich
Schlegel is not entirely wrong when he discovers elements
of irony based on an opposition between the head and the
heart in writers like Ariosto and Cervantes, who love the
very mediæval tales that they are treating in a spirit of
mockery. Yet the laughter of Cervantes is not gypsy
laughter. He is one of those who next to Shakespeare
deserve the praise of having dwelt close to the centre
of human nature and so can in only a minor degree be
ranked with the romantic ironists.</p>

<p>In the extreme type of romantic ironist not only are
intellect and emotion at loggerheads but action often
belies both: he thinks one thing and feels another and
does still a third. The most ironical contrast of all is that
between the romantic “ideal” and the actual event. The
whole of romantic morality is from this point of view, as
I have tried to show, a monstrous series of ironies. The
pacifist, for example, has been disillusioned so often that
he should by this time be able to qualify as a romantic
ironist, to look, that is, with a certain aloofness on his own
dream. The crumbling of the ideal is often so complete
indeed when put to the test that irony is at times, we
may suppose, a merciful alternative to madness. When
disillusion overtakes the uncritical enthusiast, when he
finds that he has taken some cloud bank for terra firma,
he continues to cling to his dream, but at the same time
wishes to show that he is no longer the dupe of it; and so
“hot baths of sentiment,” as Jean Paul says of his novels,
“are followed by cold douches of irony.” The true German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
master of the genre is, however, Heine. Every one
knows with what coldness his head came to survey the
enthusiasms of his heart, whether in love or politics. One
may again measure the havoc that life had wrought with
Renan’s ideals if one compares the tone of his youthful
“Future of Science” with the irony of his later writings.
He compliments Jesus by ascribing to him an ironical
detachment similar to his own. Jesus, he says, has that
mark of the superior nature&mdash;the power to rise above
his own dream and to smile down upon it. Anatole France,
who is even more completely detached from his own
dreams than his master Renan, sums up the romantic
emancipation of imagination and sensibility from any
definite centre when he says that life should have as its
supreme witnesses irony and pity.</p>

<p>Irony is on the negative side, it should be remembered,
a way of affirming one’s escape from traditional and conventional
control, of showing the supremacy of mood over
decorum. “There are poems old and new which throughout
breathe the divine breath of irony. … Within lives
the poet’s mood that surveys all, rising infinitely above
everything finite, even above his own art, virtue or
genius.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Decorum is for the classicist the grand masterpiece
to observe because it is only thus he can show that
he has a genuine centre set above his own ego; it is only
by the allegiance of his imagination to this centre that
he can give the illusion of a higher reality. The romantic
ironist shatters the illusion wantonly. It is as though he
would inflict upon the reader the disillusion from which
he has himself suffered. By his swift passage from one
mood to another (<i>Stimmungsbrechung</i>) he shows that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
is subject to no centre. The effect is often that of a sudden
breaking of the spell of poetry by an intrusion of the
poet’s ego. Some of the best examples are found in that
masterpiece of romantic irony, “Don Juan.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Closely allied to the irony of emotional disillusion is a
certain type of misanthropy. You form an ideal of man
that is only an Arcadian dream and then shrink back from
man when you find that he does not correspond to your
ideal. I have said that the romantic lover does not love a
real person but only a projection of his mood. This substitution
of illusion for reality often appears in the relations
of the romanticist with other persons. Shelley, for example,
begins by seeing in Elizabeth Hitchener an angel
of light and then discovers that she is instead a “brown
demon.” He did not at any time see the real Elizabeth
Hitchener. She merely reflects back to him two of his own
moods. The tender misanthropy of the Rousseauist is at
the opposite pole from that of a Swift, which is the misanthropy
of naked intellect. Instead of seeing human nature
through an Arcadian haze he saw it without any illusion
at all. His irony is like that of Socrates, the irony of intellect.
Its bitterness and cruelty arise from the fact that his
intellect does not, like the intellect of Socrates, have the
support of insight. Pascal would have said that Swift saw
man’s misery without at the same time seeing his grandeur.
For man’s grandeur is due to his infinitude and this
infinitude cannot be perceived directly, but only through
a veil of illusion; only, that is, through a right use of the
imagination. Literary distinctions of this kind must of
course be used cautiously. Byron’s irony is prevailingly
sentimental, but along with this romantic element he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
much irony and satire that Swift would have understood
perfectly.</p>

<p>The misanthropist of the Rousseauistic or Byronic
type has a resource that was denied to Swift. Having
failed to find companionship among men he can flee to
nature. Rousseau relates how when he had taken refuge
on St. Peter’s Island he “exclaimed at times with deep
emotion: Oh nature, oh my mother, here I am under your
protection alone. Here is no adroit and rascally man to
interpose between you and me.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Few aspects of romanticism
are more important than this attempt to find companionship
and consolation in nature.</p>

<span class="smaller">ROMANTICISM AND NATURE</span></h2>

<p>One of the most disquieting features of the modern movement
is the vagueness and ambiguity of its use of the
word nature and the innumerable sophistries that have
resulted. One can sympathize at times with Sir Leslie
Stephen’s wish that the word might be suppressed entirely.
This looseness of definition may be said to begin
with the very rise of naturalism in the Renaissance, and
indeed to go back to the naturalists of Greek and Roman
antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Even writers like Rabelais and Molière are not
free from the suspicion of juggling dangerously on occasion
with the different meanings of the word nature. But
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were not merely
naturalistic, they were also humanistic, and what they
usually meant by nature, as I have pointed out, was the
conception of normal, representative human nature that
they had worked out with the aid of the ancients. There
is undeniably an element of narrowness and artificiality
in this conception of nature, and a resulting unfriendliness,
as appears in Pope’s definition of wit, towards originality
and invention. In his “Art of Poetry” Boileau says,
“Let nature be your sole study.” What he means by
nature appears a few lines later: “Study the court and
become familiar with the town.” To this somewhat conventionalized
human nature the original genius opposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
as we have seen, the cult of primitive nature. A whole
revolution is implied in Byron’s line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I love not man the less, but nature more.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Any study of this topic must evidently turn on the question
how far at different times and by different schools of
thought the realm of man and the realm of nature (as
Byron uses the word) have been separated and in what
way, and also how far they have been run together and
in what way. For there may be different ways of running
together man and nature. Ruskin’s phrase the “pathetic
fallacy” is unsatisfactory because it fails to recognize this
fact. The man who is guilty of the pathetic fallacy sees
in nature emotions that are not really there but only in
himself. Extreme examples of this confusion abound in
Ruskin’s own writings. Now the ancients also ran man
and nature together, but in an entirely different way.
The Greek we are told never saw the oak tree without
at the same time seeing the dryad. There is in this and
similar associations a sort of overflow of the human realm
upon the forms of outer nature whereas the Rousseauist
instead of bestowing imaginatively upon the oak tree a
conscious life and an image akin to his own and so lifting
it up to his level, would, if he could, become an oak tree
and so enjoy its unconscious and vegetative felicity. The
Greek, one may say, humanized nature; the Rousseauist
naturalizes man. Rousseau’s great discovery was revery;
and revery is just this imaginative melting of man into
outer nature. If the ancients failed to develop in a marked
degree this art of revery, it was not because they lacked
naturalists. Both Stoics and Epicureans, the two main
varieties of naturalists with which classical antiquity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
familiar, inclined to affirm the ultimate identity of the
human and the natural order. But both Stoics and Epicureans
would have found it hard to understand the
indifference to the intellect and its activities that Rousseauistic
revery implies. The Stoics to be sure employed
the intellect on an impossible and disheartening task&mdash;that
of founding on the natural order virtues that
the natural order does not give. The Epicureans remind
one rather in much of their intellectual activity of the
modern man of science. But the Epicurean was less prone
than the man of science to look on man as the mere passive
creature of environment. The views of the man of
science about the springs of conduct often seem to coincide
rather closely with those of Rousseau about “sensitive
morality.” Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire says that when
reclining on the banks of the Nile he felt awakening
within himself the instincts of the crocodile. The point
of view is Rousseauistic perhaps rather than genuinely
scientific. An Epicurus or a Lucretius would, we are probably
safe in assuming, have been disquieted by any such
surrender to the subrational, by any such encroachment
of the powers of the unconscious upon conscious control.</p>

<p>It is hard as a matter of fact to find in the ancients
anything resembling Rousseauistic revery, even when
they yield to the pastoral mood. Nature interests them as
a rule less for its own sake than as a background for
human action; and when they are concerned primarily
with nature, it is a nature that has been acted upon by
man. They have a positive shrinking from wild and uncultivated
nature. “The green pastures and golden slopes
of England,” says Lowell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> “are sweeter both to the outward
and to the inward eye that the hand of man has
immemorially cared for and caressed them.” This is an
attitude towards nature that an ancient would have
understood perfectly. One may indeed call it the Virgilian
attitude from the ancient who has perhaps expressed it
most happily. The man who lives in the grand manner
may indeed wish to impose on nature some of the fine
proportion and symmetry of which he is conscious in
himself and he may then from our modern point of view
carry the humanizing of nature too far. “Let us sing of
woods,” says Virgil, “but let the woods be worthy of
a consul.” This line has sometimes been taken to be a
prophecy of the Park of Versailles. We may sympathize
up to a certain point with the desire to introduce a human
symmetry into nature (such as appears, for instance, in
the Italian garden), but the peril is even greater here
than elsewhere of confounding the requirements of a real
with those of an artificial decorum. I have already mentioned
the neo-classicist who complained that the stars
in heaven were not arranged in sufficiently symmetrical
patterns.</p>

<p>What has been said should make clear that though
both humanist and Rousseauist associate man with nature
it is in very different ways, and that there is therefore
an ambiguity in the expression “pathetic fallacy.” It remains
to show that men may not only associate themselves
with nature in different ways but that they may
likewise differ in their ways of asserting man’s separateness
from nature. The chief distinction to be made here
is that between the humanist and the supernaturalist.
Some sense of the gap between man and the “outworld”
is almost inevitable and forces itself at times even upon
those most naturalistically inclined:</p>

<p>The Wordsworth who speaks here is scarcely the Wordsworth
of Tintern Abbey or the Wordsworth whose “daily
teachers had been woods and rills.” He reminds us rather
of Socrates who gave as his reason for going so rarely
into the country, delightful as he found it when once
there, that he did not learn from woods and rills but
from the “men in the cities.” This sense of the separateness
of the human and the natural realm may be carried
much further&mdash;to a point where an ascetic distrust of
nature begins to appear. Something of this ascetic distrust
is seen for example in the following lines from Cardinal
Newman:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">There strayed awhile amid the woods of Dart</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The origins of this latter attitude towards nature are to
be sought in mediæval Christianity rather than in classical
antiquity. No man who knows the facts would assert for
a moment that the man of the Middle Ages was incapable
of looking on nature with other feelings than those of
ascetic distrust. It is none the less true that the man of
the Middle Ages often saw in nature not merely something
alien but a positive temptation and peril of the spirit. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
his attitude towards nature as in other respects Petrarch
is usually accounted the first modern. He did what no
man of the mediæval period is supposed to have done
before him, or indeed what scarcely any man of classical
antiquity did: he ascended a mountain out of sheer curiosity
and simply to enjoy the prospect. But those who
tell of his ascent of Mt. Ventoux sometimes forget to
add that the passage of Saint Augustine<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> that occurred to
him at the top reflects the distrust of the more austere
Christian towards the whole natural order. Petrarch is
at once more ascetic and more romantic in his attitude
towards nature than the Greek or Roman.</p>

<p>Traces of Petrarch’s taste for solitary and even for wild
nature are to be found throughout the Renaissance and
the seventeenth century. But the recoil from supernaturalism
that took place at this time led rather, as I have
remarked, to a revival of the Græco-Roman humanism
with something more of artifice and convention, and to an
even more marked preference<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> of the town to the country.
An age that aims first of all at urbanity must necessarily
be more urban than rural in its predilections. It was
a sort of condescension for the neo-classical humanist to
turn from the central model he was imitating to mere
unadorned nature, and even then he felt that he must
be careful not to condescend too far. Even when writing
pastorals he was warned by Scaliger to avoid details
that are too redolent of the real country; he should indulge
at most in an “urbane rusticity.” Wild nature the
neo-classicist finds simply repellent. Mountains he looks
upon as “earth’s dishonor and encumbering load.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Alps were regarded as the place where Nature swept up
the rubbish of the earth to clear the plains of Lombardy.
“At last,” says a German traveller of the seventeenth
century, “we left the horrible and wearisome mountains
and the beautiful flat landscape was joyfully welcomed.”
The taste for mountain scenery is associated no doubt to
some extent, as has been suggested, with the increasing
ease and comfort of travel that has come with the progress
of the utilitarian movement. It is scarcely necessary
to point the contrast between the Switzerland of which
Evelyn tells in his diary<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and the Switzerland in which
one may go by funicular to the top of the Jungfrau.</p>

<p>Those who in the eighteenth century began to feel the
need of less trimness in nature and human nature
were not it is true entirely without neo-classic predecessors.
They turned at times to painting&mdash;as the very
word picturesque testifies&mdash;for the encouragement they
failed to find in literature. A landscape was picturesque
when it seemed like a picture<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and it might be not merely
irregular but savage if it were to seem like some of the
pictures of Salvator Rosa. This association of even wildness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
with art is very characteristic of eighteenth-century
sentimentalism. It is a particular case of that curious
blending in this period of the old principle of the imitation
of models with the new principle of spontaneity.
There was a moment when a man needed to show a
certain taste for wildness if he was to be conventionally
correct. “The fops,” says Taine, describing Rousseau’s
influence on the drawing-rooms, “dreamt between two
madrigals of the happiness of sleeping naked in the virgin
forest.” The prince in Goethe’s “Triumph of Sensibility”
has carried with him on his travels canvas
screens so painted that when placed in position they
give him the illusion of being in the midst of a wild
landscape. This taste for artificial wildness can however
best be studied in connection with the increasing
vogue in the eighteenth century of the English garden as
compared either with the Italian garden or the French
garden in the style of Le Nôtre.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> As a relief from the
neo-classical symmetry, nature was broken up, often at
great expense, into irregular and unexpected aspects.
Some of the English gardens in France and Germany
were imitated directly from Rousseau’s famous description
of this method of dealing with the landscape in the
“Nouvelle Héloïse.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Artificial ruins were often placed
in the English garden as a further aid to those who
wished to wander imaginatively from the beaten path,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and also as a provocative of the melancholy that was
already held to be distinguished. Towards the end of the
century this cult of ruins was widespread. The veritable
obsession with ruins that one finds in Chateaubriand
is not unrelated to this sentimental fashion, though it
arises even more perhaps from the real ruins that had
been so plentifully supplied by the Revolution.</p>

<p>Rousseau himself, it should hardly be necessary to say,
stands for far more than an artificial wildness. Instead
of imposing decorum on nature like the neo-classicist,
he preached constantly the elimination of decorum from
man. Man should flee from that “false taste for grandeur
which is not made for him” and which “poisons his pleasures,”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
to nature. Now “it is on the summits of mountains,
in the depths of forests, on deserted islands that
nature reveals her most potent charms.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The man of
feeling finds the savage and deserted nook filled with
beauties that seem horrible to the mere worldling.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Rousseau
indeed did not crave the ultimate degree of wildness
even in the Alps. He did not get beyond what one may
term the middle zone of Alpine scenery&mdash;scenery that
may be found around the shores of Lake Leman. He was
inclined to find the most appropriate setting for the earthly
paradise in the neighborhood of Vevey. Moreover, others
about the same time and more or less independently of
his influence were opposing an even more primitive nature
to the artificialities of civilization. The mountains of
“Ossian” are, as has been said, mere blurs, yet the new
delight in mountains is due in no small measure throughout
Europe to the Ossianic influence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The instinct for getting away from the beaten track, for
exploration and discovery, has of course been highly developed
at other epochs, notably at the Renaissance.
Much of the romantic interest in the wild and waste
places of the earth did not go much beyond what might
have been felt in Elizabethan England. Many of the
Rousseauists, Wordsworth and Chateaubriand for example,
not only read eagerly the older books of travel but
often the same books. The fascination of penetrating to
regions “where foot of man hath ne’er or rarely been,” is
perennial. It was my privilege a few years ago to listen
to Sir Ernest Shackleton speak of his expedition across
the Antarctic continent and of the thrill that he and the
members of his party felt when they saw rising before them
day after day mountain peaks that no human eye had
ever gazed upon. The emotion was no doubt very similar
to that of “stout Cortez” when he first “stared at
the Pacific.” Chateaubriand must have looked forward
to similar emotions when he planned his trip to North
America in search of the North West Passage. But the
passion for actual exploration which is a form of the
romanticism of action is very subordinate in the case of
Chateaubriand to emotional romanticism. He went into
the wilderness first of all not to make actual discoveries but
to affirm his freedom from conventional restraint, and at
the same time to practice the new art of revery. His sentiments
on getting into what was then the virgin forest
to the west of Albany were very different we may assume
from those of the early pioneers of America. “When,” he
says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> “after passing the Mohawk I entered woods which
had never felt the axe, I was seized by a sort of intoxication
of independence: I went from tree to tree, to right
and left, saying to myself, ‘Here are no more roads or
cities or monarchy or republic or presidents or kings or
men.’ And in order to find out if I was restored to my
original rights I did various wilful things that made my
guide furious. In his heart he believed me mad.” The
disillusion that followed is also one that the early pioneers
would have had some difficulty in understanding.
For he goes on to relate that while he was thus rejoicing
in his escape from conventional life to pure nature he
suddenly bumped up against a shed, and under the shed
he saw his first savages&mdash;a score of them both men and
women. A little Frenchman named M. Violet, “bepowdered
and befrizzled, with an apple-green coat, drugget
waistcoat and muslin frill and cuffs, was scraping on a
pocket fiddle” and teaching the Indians to dance to
the tune of Madelon Friquet. M. Violet, it seemed, had
remained behind on the departure from New York of
Rochambeau’s forces at the time of the American Revolution,
and had set up as dancing-master among the
savages. He was very proud of the nimbleness of his
pupils and always referred to them as “ces messieurs
sauvages et ces dames sauvagesses.” “Was it not a crushing
circumstance for a disciple of Rousseau,” Chateaubriand
concludes, “this introduction to savage life by a
ball that the ex-scullion of General Rochambeau was
giving to Iroquois? I felt very much like laughing, but
I was at the same time cruelly humiliated.”</p>

<p>In America, as elsewhere, Chateaubriand’s chief concern
is not with any outer fact or activity, but with his
own emotions and the enhancement of these emotions by
his imagination. In him as in many other romanticists
the different elements of Rousseauism&mdash;Arcadian longing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the pursuit of the dream woman, the aspiration towards
the “infinite” (often identified with God)&mdash;appear
at times more or less separately and then again almost
inextricably blended with one another and with the cult
of nature. It may be well to consider more in detail these
various elements of Rousseauism and their relation to
nature in about the order I have mentioned. The association
of Arcadian longing with nature is in part an outcome
of the conflict between the ideal and the real. The
romantic idealist finds that men do not understand him:
his “vision” is mocked and his “genius” is unrecognized.
The result is the type of sentimental misanthropy of
which I spoke at the end of the last chapter. He feels,
as Lamartine says, that there is nothing in common
between the world and him. Lamartine adds, however,
“But nature is there who invites you and loves you.” You
will find in her the comprehension and companionship
that you have failed to find in society. And nature will
seem a perfect companion to the Rousseauist in direct
proportion as she is uncontaminated by the presence of
man. Wordsworth has described the misanthropy that
supervened in many people on the collapse of the revolutionary
idealism. He himself overcame it, though there
is more than a suggestion in the manner of his own retirement
into the hills of a man who retreats into an Arcadian
dream from actual defeat. The suggestion of defeat
is much stronger in Ruskin’s similar retirement. Ruskin
doubtless felt in later life, like Rousseau, that if he had
failed to get on with men “it was less his fault than
theirs.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Perhaps emotional misanthropy and the worship
of wild nature are nowhere more fully combined than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Byron. He gives magnificent expression to the most untenable
of paradoxes&mdash;that one escapes from solitude by
eschewing human haunts in favor of some wilderness.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
In these haunts, he says, he became like a “falcon with
clipped wing,” but found in nature the kindest of mothers.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>He not only finds companionship in nature but at the
same time partakes of her infinitude&mdash;an infinitude, one
should note, of feeling:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I live not in myself, but I become</div>
<div class="verse">Portion of that around me; and to me</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>In his less misanthropic moods the Rousseauist sees in
wild nature not only a refuge from society, but also a
suitable setting for his companionship with the ideal
mate, for what the French term <i>la solitude à deux</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Oh! that the Desert were my dwelling-place</div>
<div class="verse">With one fair Spirit for my minister,</div>
<div class="verse">That I might all forget the human race</div>
<div class="verse">And, hating no one, love but only her!<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The almost innumerable passages in the romantic
movement that celebrate this Arcadian companionship
in the wilderness merely continue in a sense the pastoral
mood that must be as old as human nature itself. But in
the past the pastoral mood has been comparatively placid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
It has not been associated in any such degree with misanthropy
and wildness, with nympholeptic longing and
the thirst for the infinite. The scene that Chateaubriand
has imagined between Chactas and Atala in the primeval
forest, is surely the stormiest of Arcadias; so stormy indeed
that it would have been unintelligible to Theocritus.
It is not certain that it would have been intelligible to
Shakespeare, who like the other Elizabethans felt at times
that he too had been born in Arcadia. The Arcadian of
the past was much less inclined to sink down to the subrational
and to merge his personality in the landscape.
Rousseau describes with a charm that has scarcely been
surpassed by any of his disciples, the reveries in which he
thus descends below the level of his rational self. Time,
no longer broken up by the importunate intellect and
its analysis, is then felt by him in its unbroken flow;
the result is a sort of “eternal present that leaves no
sense of emptiness.” Of such a moment of revery Rousseau
says, anticipating Faust, that he “would like it
to last forever.” Bergson in his conception of the <i>summum
bonum</i> as a state in which time is no longer cut up
into artificial segments but is perceived in its continuous
stream as a “present that endures,”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> has done little more
than repeat Rousseau. The sight and sound of water
seem to have been a special aid to revery in Rousseau’s
case. His accounts of the semi-dissolution of his conscious
self that he enjoyed while drifting idly on the Lake of
Bienne are justly celebrated. Lamartine’s soul was, like
that of Rousseau, lulled by “the murmur of waters.”
Nothing again is more Rousseauistic than the desire
Arnold attributes to Maurice de Guérin&mdash;the desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
“to be borne on forever down an enchanted stream.”
That too is why certain passages of Shelley are so near
in spirit to Rousseau&mdash;for example, the boat revery in
“Prometheus Unbound” in which an Arcadian nature
and the dream companion mingle to the strains of music
in a way that is supremely romantic.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>The association of nature with Arcadian longing and
the pursuit of the dream woman is even less significant
than its association with the idea of the infinite. For as
a result of this latter association the nature cult often
assumes the aspect of a religion. The various associations
may indeed as I have said be very much blended
or else may run into one another almost insensibly. No
better illustration of this blending can be found perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
than in Chateaubriand&mdash;especially in that compendium
of Rousseauistic psychology, his “René.” The soul of
René, one learns, was too great to adjust itself to the
society of men. He found that he would have to contract
his life if he put himself on their level. Men, for their part,
treated him as a dreamer, and so he is forced more and
more by his increasing disgust for them into solitude. Now
René rests the sense of his superiority over other men on
two things: first, on his superlative capacity to feel
grief;<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> secondly, on his thirst for the infinite. “What is
finite,” he says, “has no value for me.” What is thus
pushing him beyond all bounds is “an unknown good of
which the instinct pursues me.” “I began to ask myself
what I desired. I did not know but I thought all of a
sudden that the woods would be delicious to me!” What
he found in this quest for the mystical something that
was to fill the abyss of his existence was the dream
woman. “I went down into the valley, I strode upon the
mountain, summoning with all the force of my desire the
ideal object of a future flame; I embraced this object in
the winds; I thought that I heard it in the moanings of
the river. All was this phantom of the imagination&mdash;both
the stars in heaven and the very principle of life in
the universe.” I have already quoted a very similar passage
and pointed out the equivalent in Shelley. No such
close equivalent could be found in Byron, and Wordsworth,
it is scarcely necessary to say, offers no equivalent
at all. If one reads on, however, one finds passages that
are Byronic and others that are Wordsworthian. Paganism,
Chateaubriand complains, by seeing in nature only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
certain definite forms&mdash;fauns and satyrs and nymphs&mdash;had
banished from it both God and the infinite. But
Christianity expelled these thronging figures in turn
and restored to the grottoes their silence and to the woods
their revery. The true God thus became visible in his
works and bestowed upon them his own immensity.
What Chateaubriand understands by God and the infinite
appears in the following description of the region near
Niagara seen by moonlight. The passage is Byronic as
a whole with a Wordsworthian touch at the end. “The
grandeur, the amazing melancholy of this picture cannot
be expressed in human language; the fairest night of
Europe can give no conception of it. In vain in our cultivated
fields does the imagination seek to extend itself.
It encounters on every hand the habitations of men; but
in these savage regions the soul takes delight in plunging
into an ocean of forests, in hovering over the gulf of cataracts,
in meditating on the shores of lakes and rivers and,
so to speak, in finding itself alone in the presence of God.”
The relation between wild and solitary nature and the
romantic idea of the infinite is here obvious. It is an aid
to the spirit in throwing off its limitations and so in feeling
itself “free.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>A greater spiritual elevation it is sometimes asserted
is found in Wordsworth’s communings with nature than
in those of Rousseau and Chateaubriand. The difference
perhaps is less one of spirit than of temperament. In its
abdication of the intellectual and critical faculties, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
its semi-dissolution of the conscious self, the revery of
Wordsworth does not differ from that of Rousseau<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and
Chateaubriand, but the erotic element is absent. In the
“Genius of Christianity” Chateaubriand gives a magnificent
description of sunset at sea and turns the whole
picture into a proof of God. Elsewhere he tells us that it
was “not God alone that I contemplated on the waters
in the splendor of his works. I saw an unknown woman
and the miracle of her smile. … I should have sold eternity
for one of her caresses. I imagined that she was
palpitating behind that veil of the universe that hid her
from my eyes,” etc. Wordsworth was at least consistently
religious in his attitude towards the landscape: he did not
see in it at one moment God, and at another an unknown
woman and the miracle of her smile. At the same time his
idea of spirituality is very remote from the traditional
conception. Formerly spirituality was held to be a
process of recollection, of gathering one’s self in, that is,
towards the centre and not of diffusive emotion; so that
when a man wished to pray he retired into his closet, and
did not, like a Wordsworth or a Rousseau, fall into an
inarticulate ecstasy before the wonders of nature. As for
the poets of the past, they inclined as a rule to look on
nature as an incentive not to religion but to love. Keble,
following Wordsworth, protests on this ground against
Aristophanes, and Catullus and Horace and Theocritus.
He might have lengthened the list almost indefinitely.
Chateaubriand bids us in our devotional moods to betake
ourselves “to the religious forest.” La Fontaine is at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
as near to normal human experience and also at least as
poetical when he warns “fair ones” to “fear the depths of
the woods and their vast silence.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>No one would question that Wordsworth has passages
of great ethical elevation. But in some of these passages
he simply renews the error of the Stoics who also display
at times great ethical elevation; he ascribes to the natural
order virtues that the natural order does not give. This
error persists to some extent even when he is turning
away, as in the “Ode to Duty,” from the moral spontaneity
of the Rousseauist. It is not quite clear that the
law of duty in the breast of man is the same law that preserves
“the stars from wrong.” His earlier assertion that
the light of setting suns and the mind of man are identical
in their essence is at best highly speculative, at least
as speculative as the counter assertion of Sir Thomas
Browne that “there is surely a piece of divinity in us;
something that was before the elements, and owes no
homage unto the sun.” Furthermore this latter sense of
the gap between man and nature seems to be more fully
justified by its fruits in life and conduct, and this is after
all the only test that counts in the long run.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why pantheistic revery has been so
popular is that it seems to offer a painless substitute for
genuine spiritual effort. In its extreme exponents, a
Rousseau or a Walt Whitman, it amounts to a sort of
ecstatic animality that sets up as a divine illumination.
Even in its milder forms it encourages one to assume a
tone of consecration in speaking of experiences that are
æsthetic rather than truly religious. “’Tis only heaven
that’s given away,” sings Lowell;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> “’Tis only God may
be had for the asking.” God and heaven are accorded
by Lowell with such strange facility because he identifies
them with the luxurious enjoyment of a “day in June.”
When pushed to a certain point the nature cult always
tends towards sham spirituality.</p>

</div>

<p>It seems to follow from these verses of Browning, perhaps
the most flaccid spiritually in the English language,
that to go out and mix one’s self up with the landscape
is the same as doing one’s duty. As a method of salvation
this is even easier and more æsthetic than that of the
Ancient Mariner, who, it will be remembered, is relieved
of the burden of his transgression by admiring the color
of water-snakes!</p>

<p>The nature cult arose at a time when the traditional
religious symbols were becoming incredible. Instead of
working out new and firm distinctions between good
and evil, the Rousseauist seeks to discredit all precise
distinctions whether new or old, in favor of mere emotional
intoxication. The passage to which I have already
alluded, in which Faust breaks down the scruples of
Marguerite by proclaiming the supremacy of feeling,
surpasses even the lines I have cited from Browning as
an example of sham spirituality:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The upshot of this enthusiasm that overflows all boundaries
and spurns definition as mere smoke that veils its
heavenly glow is the seduction of a poor peasant girl.
Such is the romantic contrast between the “ideal” and
the “real.”</p>

<p>Those to whom I may seem to be treating the nature
cult with undue severity should remember that I am
treating it only in its pseudo-religious aspect. In its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
proper place all this refining on man’s relation to the
“outworld” may be legitimate and delightful; but that
place is secondary. My quarrel is only with the æsthete
who assumes an apocalyptic pose and gives forth as a
profound philosophy what is at best only a holiday or
week-end view of existence. No distinction is more important
for any one who wishes to maintain a correct
scale of values than that between what is merely recreative
and what ministers to leisure. There are times when
we may properly seek solace and renewal in nature, when
we may invite both our souls and our bodies to loaf. The
error is to look on these moments of recreation and relief
from concentration on some definite end as in themselves
the consummation of wisdom. Rousseau indeed assumes
that his art of mixing himself up with the landscape
is identical with leisure; like innumerable disciples
he confuses revery with meditation&mdash;a confusion
so grave that I shall need to revert to it later. He parodies
subtly what is above the ordinary rational level in
terms of what is below it. He thus brings under suspicion
the most necessary of all truths&mdash;that the kingdom of
heaven is within us.</p>

<p>The first place always belongs to action and purpose
and not to mere idling, even if it be like that of the Rousseauist
transcendental idling. The man who makes a
deliberate choice and then plans his life with reference
to it is less likely than the aimless man to be swayed by
every impulse and impression. The figures of Raphael
according to Hazlitt have always “a set, determined,
voluntary character,” they “want that wild uncertainty
of expression which is connected with the accidents of
nature and the changes of the elements.” And Hazlitt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
therefore concludes rightly that Raphael has “nothing
romantic about him.” The distinction is so important
that it might be made the basis for a comparison between
the painting of the Renaissance and some of the important
schools of the nineteenth century. Here again no
sensible person would maintain that the advantage is all
on one side. Romanticism gave a great impulse to landscape
painting and to the painting of man in the landscape.
Few romantic gains are more indubitable. One
may prefer the best work of the Barbizon school for
example to the contemporary product in French literature.
But even here it must be insisted that painting from
which man is absent or in which he is more or less subordinated
to the landscape is not the highest type of painting.
Turner, one of the greatest masters of landscape, was
almost incapable of painting the human figure. Ruskin is
therefore indulging in romantic paradox when he puts
Turner in the same class as Shakespeare. Turner’s vision
of life as compared with that of Shakespeare is not central
but peripheral.</p>

<p>The revolution that has resulted from the triumph of
naturalistic over humanistic tendencies in painting extends
down to the minutest details of technique; it has
meant the subordination of design&mdash;the imposition, that
is, on one’s material of a firm central purpose&mdash;to light
and color; and this in painting corresponds to the literary
pursuit of glamour and illusion for their own sake. It has
meant in general a tendency to sacrifice all the other
elements of painting to the capture of the vivid and immediate
impression. And this corresponds to the readiness
of the writer to forego decorum in favor of intensity.
The choice that is involved, including a choice of technique,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
according as one is a naturalist or a humanist, is
brought out by Mr. Kenyon Cox in his comparison of
two paintings of hermits,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> one by Titian and one by John
Sargent: the impressionistic and pantheistic hermit of
Sargent is almost entirely merged in the landscape; he is
little more than a pretext for a study of the accidents
of light. The conception of Titian’s St. Jerome in the
Desert is perhaps even more humanistic than religious.
The figure of the saint on which everything converges is
not merely robust, it is even a bit robustious. The picture
affirms in its every detail the superior importance of man
and his purposes to his natural environment. So far as
their inner life is concerned the two hermits are plainly
moving in opposite directions. An appropriate motto for
Sargent’s hermit would be the following lines that I take
from a French symbolist, but the equivalent of which
can be found in innumerable other Rousseauists:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Je voudrais me confondre avec les chases, tordre</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Mes bras centre la pierre et les fraîches écorces,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Etre l’arbre, le mur, le pollen et le sel,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Et me dissoudre au fond de l’être universel.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is to push the reciprocity between man and nature
to a point where the landscape is not only a state of the
soul but the soul is a state of the landscape; just as in
Shelley’s Ode, Shelley becomes the West Wind and the
West Wind becomes Shelley.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> The changes in the romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
soul are appropriately mirrored in the changes of the
seasons. In Tieck’s “Genoveva,” for example, Golo’s love
blossoms in the springtime, the sultry summer impels
him to sinful passion, the autumn brings grief and repentance,
and in winter avenging judgment overtakes the
offender and casts him into the grave.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Autumn is perhaps
even more than springtime the favorite season of
the Rousseauist. The movement is filled with souls who
like the hero of Poe’s “Ulalume” have reached the October
of their sensations. Some traces of this sympathetic
relation between man and nature may indeed be found
in the literature of the past. The appropriateness of the
setting in the “Prometheus Bound” of Æschylus would
scarcely seem to be an accident. The storm in “Lear” may
also be instanced. But as I have already said occidental
man did not before Rousseau show much inclination to
mingle with the landscape. The parallelism that Pater
establishes in “Marius the Epicurean” between the
moods of the hero and the shifting aspects of nature is felt
as a distinct anachronism. If we wish to find any early
approximations to the subtleties and refinements of the
Rousseauist in his dealings with nature we need to turn
to the Far East&mdash;especially to the Taoist movement in
China.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> As a result of the Taoist influence China had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
from a very early period poets and painters for whom the
landscape is very plainly a state of the soul.</p>

<p>Pantheistic revery of the kind I have been describing
leads inevitably to a special type of symbolism. The
Rousseauist reads into nature unutterable love. He sees
shining through its finite forms the light of the infinite.
The Germans especially set out to express symbolically
the relationship between the love and infinitude that they
saw in nature and the kindred elements in themselves.
Any one who has attempted to thread his way through
the German theories of the symbol will feel that he has,
like Wordsworth’s shepherd, “been in the heart of many
thousand mists.” But in view of the importance of the
subject it is necessary to venture for a moment into this
metaphysical murk. Schelling’s “Nature Philosophy” is
perhaps the most ambitious of all the German attempts
to run together symbolically the human spirit and phenomenal
nature. “What we call nature,” says Schelling,
“is a poem that lies hidden in a secret wondrous writing”;
if the riddle could be revealed we should recognize in
nature “the Odyssey of the Spirit.” “There looks out
through sensuous objects as through a half-transparent
mist the world of phantasy for which we long.” “All
things are only a garment of the world of spirit.” “To
be romantic,” says Uhland, “is to have an inkling of the
infinite in appearances.” “Beauty,” says Schelling in
similar vein, “is a finite rendering of the infinite.” Now
the infinite and the finite can only be thus brought together
through the medium of the symbol. Therefore, as
A. W. Schlegel says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> “beauty is a symbolical representation
of the infinite. All poetry is an everlasting symbolizing.”</p>

<p>This assertion is in an important sense true. Unfortunately
there remains the ambiguity that I have already
pointed out in the word “infinite.” No one would give a
high rating to a certain type of allegory that flourished
in neo-classical times as also in a somewhat different
form during the Middle Ages. It is a cold intellectual
contrivance in which the imagination has little part and
which therefore fails to suggest the infinite in any sense.
But to universalize the particular in the classical sense is
to give access imaginatively to the human infinite that is
set above nature. Every successful humanistic creation
is more or less symbolical. Othello is not merely a jealous
man; he is also a symbol of jealousy. Some of the myths of
Plato again are imaginative renderings of a supersensuous
realm to which man has no direct access. They are
symbolical representations of an infinite that the romanticist
leaves out of his reckoning. The humanistic and
spiritual symbols that abound in the religion and poetry
of the past, are then, it would seem, very different from
the merely æsthetic symbolizing of a Schelling. For
Schelling is one of the chief of those who from Shaftesbury
down have tended to identify beauty and truth
and to make both purely æsthetic. But a symbol that
is purely æsthetic, that is in other words purely a matter
of feeling, rests on what is constantly changing not
only from man to man but in the same man. Romantic
symbolism, therefore, though it claims at one moment to
be scientific (especially in Germany) and at another moment
to have a religious value, is at bottom the symbolizing
of mood. Both the imagination and the emotion that
enter into the romantic symbol are undisciplined. The
results of such a symbolism do not meet the demand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the genuine man of science for experimental proof, they
do not again satisfy the test of universality imposed by
those who believe in a distinctively human realm that is
set above nature. The nature philosophy of a Schelling
leads therefore on the one hand to sham science and on
the other to sham philosophy and religion.</p>

<p>The genuine man of science has as a matter of fact
repudiated the speculations of Schelling and other romantic
physicists as fantastic. He may also be counted
on to look with suspicion on the speculations of a Bergson
who, more perhaps than any living Rousseauist,
reminds one of the German romantic philosophers. One
idea has however lingered in the mind even of the genuine
man of science as a result of all this romantic theorizing&mdash;namely
that man has access to the infinite only
through nature. Thus Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn
said in a recent address to the students of Columbia University:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I would not for a moment take advantage of the present opportunity
to discourage the study of human nature and of the humanities,
but for what is called the best opening for a constructive career give
me nature. The ground for my preference is that human nature is an
exhaustible fountain of research; Homer understood it well; Solomon
fathomed it; Shakespeare divined it, both normal and abnormal; the
modernists have been squeezing out the last drops of abnormality.
Nature, studied since Aristotle’s time, is still full to the brim; no
perceptible falling of its tides is evident from any point at which it is
attacked, from nebulæ to protoplasm; it is always wholesome, refreshing
and invigorating. Of the two most creative literary artists of
our time, Maeterlinck, jaded with human abnormality, comes back
to the bee and the flowers and the “blue bird,” with a delicious renewal
of youth, while Rostand turns to the barnyard.</p>

</div>

<p>The romanticists acted from the start, following here
in the wake of the pseudo-classicists, on Professor Osbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>n’s
assumption that normal human nature is something
that may be bottled up once for all and put by on a
shelf, though they would have been pained to learn from
him that even abnormal human nature may also be bottled
up and put by in the same fashion. Sophistries of
this kind should perhaps be pardoned in the man of
science when so many men who are supposed to stand
for letters have shown him the way. Great literature is
an imaginative and symbolical interpretation of an infinite
that is accessible only to those who possess in some degree
the same type of imagination. A writer like Maeterlinck,
whom Professor Osborn takes to be representative
of literature in general, is merely a late exponent of a
movement that from the start turned away from this
human infinite towards pantheistic revery.</p>

<p>The imagination is, as Coleridge says, the great unifying
power; it draws together things that are apparently
remote. But its analogies to be of value should surely have
validity apart from the mere shifting mood of the man
who perceives them. Otherwise he simply wrests some
outer object from the chain of cause and effect of which
it is actually a part, and incorporates it arbitrarily into
his own private dream. Wordsworth is not sparing of
homely detail in his account of his leech-gatherer; but at
a given moment in this poem the leech-gatherer undergoes
a strange transformation; he loses all verisimilitude
as a leech-gatherer and becomes a romantic symbol, a
mere projection, that is, of the poet’s own broodings.
To push this symbolizing of mood beyond a certain point
is incipient hallucination. We are told that when the
asylum at Charenton was shelled in the Franco-Prussian
War of 1870, the lunatics saw reflected in the bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
bombs, each in a different way, his own madness. One
took the bombs to be a link in the plot of his enemies
against him, etc. It is hard to consider the symbolizing
and visions of the extreme romanticist, such as those of
William Blake, without thinking at times of Charenton.</p>

<p>What I have said of the romantic symbol is true in
some degree of the romantic metaphor, for the symbol
and even the myth are often only a developed metaphor.
The first part of the romantic metaphor, the image or
impression that has been received from the outer world, is
often admirably fresh and vivid.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> But the second part of
the metaphor when the analogy involved is that between
some fact of outer perception and the inner life of man is
often vague and misty; for the inner life in which the
romanticist takes interest is not the life he possesses in
common with other men but what is most unique in his
own emotions&mdash;his mood in short. That is why the
metaphor and still more the symbol in so far as they are
romantic are always in danger of becoming unintelligible,
since it is not easy for one man to enter into another’s
mood. Men accord a ready welcome to metaphors and
symbols that instead of expressing something more or
less individual have a real relevancy to their common
nature. Tribulation, for example, means literally the
beating out of grain on the threshing floor. The man who
first saw the analogy between this process and certain
spiritual experiences established a legitimate link between
nature and human nature, between sense and the
supersensuous. Language is filled with words and expressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
of this kind which have become so current that
their metaphorical and symbolical character has been
forgotten and which have at the same time ceased to be
vivid and concrete and become abstract.</p>

<p>The primitivistic fallacies of the German romanticists
in their dealings with the symbol and metaphor appear
in various forms in French romanticism and even more
markedly in its continuation known as the symbolistic
movement. What is exasperating in many of the poets
of this school is that they combine the pretence to a vast
illumination with the utmost degree of spiritual and intellectual
emptiness and vagueness. Like the early German
romanticists they mix up flesh and spirit in nympholeptic
longing and break down and blur all the boundaries of
being in the name of the infinite. Of this inner formlessness
and anarchy the chaos of the <i>vers libre</i> (in which they
were also anticipated by the Germans) is only an outer
symptom.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>If the Rousseauistic primitivist recognizes the futility
of his symbolizing, and consents to become a passive
register of outer perception, if for example he proclaims
himself an imagist, he at least has the merit of frankness,
but in that case he advertises by the very name he has
assumed the bankruptcy of all that is most worth while
in poetry.</p>

<p>But to return to romanticism and nature. It should be
plain from what has already been said that the romanticist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
tends to make of nature the mere plaything of his
mood. When Werther’s mood is cheerful, nature smiles
at him benignly. When his mood darkens she becomes for
him “a devouring monster.” When it grows evident to
the romanticist that nature does not alter with his alteration,
he chides her at times for her impassibility; or again
he seeks to be impassible like her, even if he can be so
only at the expense of his humanity. This latter attitude
is closely connected with the dehumanizing of man by
science that is reflected in a whole literature during the
last half of the nineteenth century&mdash;for instance, in so-called
“impassive” writers like Flaubert and Leconte
de Lisle.</p>

<p>The causal sequences that had been observed in the
physical realm were developed more and more during
this period with the aid of pure mathematics and the
mathematical reason (<i>esprit de géométrie</i>) into an all-embracing
system. For the earlier romanticists nature
had at least been a living presence whether benign or
sinister. For the mathematical determinist she tends to
become a soulless, pitiless mechanism against which man
is helpless.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> This conception of nature is so important
that I shall need to revert to it in my treatment of melancholy.</p>

<p>The man who has accepted the universe of the mechanist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
or determinist is not always gloomy. But men in
general felt the need of some relief from the deterministic
obsession. Hence the success of the philosophy of
Bergson and similar philosophies. The glorification of
impulse (<i>élan vital</i>) that Bergson opposes to the mechanizing
of life is in its main aspects, as I have already indicated,
simply a return to the spontaneity of Rousseau.
His plan of escape from deterministic science is at bottom
very much like Rousseau’s plan of escape from the undue
rationalism of the Enlightenment. As a result of these
eighteenth-century influences, nature had, according to
Carlyle, become a mere engine, a system of cogs and
pulleys. He therefore hails Novalis as an “anti-mechanist,”
a “deep man,” because of the way of deliverance
that he teaches from this nightmare. “I owe him somewhat.”
What Carlyle owed to Novalis many moderns
have owed to Bergson, but it is not yet clear that either
Novalis or Bergson are “deep men.”</p>

<p>The mechanistic view of nature, whether held pessimistically
or optimistically, involving as it does factors
that are infinite and therefore beyond calculation, cannot
furnish proofs that will satisfy the true positivist: he is
inclined to dismiss it as a mere phantasmagoria of the
intellect. The Rousseauistic view of nature, on the other
hand, whether held optimistically or pessimistically, is
even less capable of satisfying the standards of the positivist
and must be dismissed as a mere phantasmagoria
of the emotions. The fact is that we do not know and can
never know what nature is in herself. The mysterious
mother has shrouded herself from us in an impenetrable
veil of illusion. But though we cannot know nature absolutely
we can pick up a practical and piecemeal knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of nature not by dreaming but by doing. The man
of action can within certain limits have his way with
nature. Now the men who have acted during the past
century have been the men of science and the utilitarians
who have been turning to account the discoveries of
science. The utilitarians have indeed derived such potent
aid from science that they have been able to stamp their
efforts on the very face of the landscape. The romanticists
have not ceased to protest against this scientific
utilizing of nature as a profanation. But inasmuch as
these protests have come from men who have stood not
for work but for revery they have for the most part been
futile. This is not the least of the ironic contrasts that
abound in this movement between the ideal and the real.
No age ever grew so ecstatic over natural beauty as the
nineteenth century, at the same time no age ever did so
much to deface nature. No age ever so exalted the country
over the town, and no age ever witnessed such a
crowding into urban centres.</p>

<p>A curious study might be made of this ironic contrast
as it appears in the early romantic crusade against railways.
One of the romantic grievances against the railway
is that it does not encourage vagabondage: it has a definite
goal and gets to it so far as possible in a straight line.
Yet in spite of Wordsworth’s protesting sonnet the Windermere
railway was built. Ruskin’s wrath at railways
was equally vain. In general, sentiment is not of much
avail when pitted against industrial advance. The papers
announced recently that one of the loveliest cascades in
the California Sierras had suddenly disappeared as a result
of the diversion of its water to a neighboring power-plant.
The same fate is overtaking Niagara itself. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
perhaps symbolic that a quarry has made a hideous gash
in the hillside on the shores of Rydal Mere right opposite
Wordsworth’s house.</p>

<p>If the man of science and the utilitarian do not learn
what nature is in herself they learn at least to adjust
themselves to forces outside themselves. The Rousseauist,
on the other hand, does not in his “communion”
with nature adjust himself to anything. He is simply communing
with his own mood. Rousseau chose appropriately
as title for the comedy that was his first literary
effort “Narcissus or the Lover of Himself.” The nature
over which the Rousseauist is bent in such rapt contemplation
plays the part of the pool in the legend of Narcissus.
It renders back to him his own image. He sees in
nature what he himself has put there. The Rousseauist
transfuses himself into nature in much the same way
that Pygmalion transfuses himself into his statue. Nature
is dead, as Rousseau says, unless animated by the fires
of love. “Make no mistake,” says M. Masson, “the
nature that Jean-Jacques worships is only a projection
of Jean-Jacques. He has poured himself forth so complacently
upon it that he can always find himself and
cherish himself in it.” And M. Masson goes on and quotes
from a curious and little-known fragment of Rousseau:
“Beloved solitude,” Rousseau sighs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span> “beloved solitude,
where I still pass with pleasure the remains of a life given
over to suffering. Forest with stunted trees, marshes
without water, broom, reeds, melancholy heather, inanimate
objects, you who can neither speak to me nor hear
me, what secret charm brings me back constantly into
your midst? Unfeeling and dead things, this charm is not
in you; it could not be there. It is in my own heart which
wishes to refer back everything to itself.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Coleridge
plainly only continues Rousseau when he writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">O Lady! we receive but what we give,</div>
<div class="verse">And in our life alone does nature live:<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></div>
<div class="verse">Ours is her wedding-garment, ours her shroud!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And would we aught behold, of higher worth,</div>
<div class="verse">Than that inanimate cold world allow’d</div>
<div class="verse">To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth</div>
<div class="verse">A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Enveloping the Earth.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The fair luminous cloud is no other than the Arcadian
imagination. “The light that never was on sea or land,
the consecration and the poet’s dream” of which Wordsworth
speaks, is likewise as appears very plainly from
the context,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Arcadian. He should once, Wordsworth
writes, have wished to see Peele Castle bathed in the
Arcadian light, but now that he has escaped by sympathy
for his fellow-men from the Arcadian aloofness, he is willing
that it should be painted in storm. Mere storminess, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
should recollect, is not in itself an assurance that one has
turned from the romantic dream to reality. One finds in
this movement, if nowhere else, as I remarked apropos
of Chateaubriand, the stormy Arcadia.</p>

<p>It is not through the Arcadian imagination that one
moves towards reality. This does not much matter if
what one seeks in a “return to nature” is merely recreation.
I cannot repeat too often that I have no quarrel
with the nature cult when it remains recreative but only
when it sets up as a substitute for philosophy and religion.
This involves a confusion between the two main
directions of the human spirit, a confusion as I have said
in a previous chapter between the realm of awe and the
region of wonder. Pascal exaggerates somewhat when he
says the Bible never seeks to prove religion from the
“wonders” of nature. But this remark is true to the total
spirit of the Bible. A knowledge of the flowers of the Holy
Land is less necessary for an understanding of the gospel
narrative than one might suppose from Renan.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Renan
is simply seeking to envelop Jesus so far as possible in an
Arcadian atmosphere. In so doing he is following in the
footsteps of the great father of sentimentalists. According
to M. Masson, Jesus, as depicted by Jean-Jacques, becomes
“a sort of grand master of the Golden Age.”</p>

<p>Here as elsewhere the Rousseauist is seeking to identify
the Arcadian view of life with wisdom. The result is a
series of extraordinarily subtle disguises for egoism. We
think we see the Rousseauist prostrate before the ideal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
woman or before nature or before God himself, but when
we look more closely we see that he is only (as Sainte-Beuve
said of Alfred de Vigny) “in perpetual adoration
before the holy sacrament of himself.” The fact that he
finds in nature only what he has put there seems to be
for Rousseau himself a source of satisfaction. But the
poem of Coleridge I have just quoted, in which he proclaims
that so far as nature is concerned “we receive but
what we give,” is entitled “Ode to Dejection.” One of
man’s deepest needs would seem to be for genuine communion,
for a genuine escape, that is, from his ordinary
self. The hollowness of the Rousseauistic communion with
nature as well as other Rousseauistic substitutes for
genuine communion is indissolubly bound up with the
subject of romantic melancholy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">ROMANTIC MELANCHOLY</span></h2>

<p>Rousseau and his early followers&mdash;especially perhaps
his early French followers&mdash;were very much preoccupied
with the problem of happiness. Now in a sense all men&mdash;even
those who renounce the world and mortify the flesh&mdash;aim
at happiness. The important point to determine is
what any particular person means by happiness and how
he hopes to attain it. It should be plain from all that
has been said that the Rousseauist seeks happiness in
the free play of the emotions. The “Influence of the
Passions on Happiness” is the significant title of one of
Madame de Staël’s early treatises. The happiness that
the Rousseauist seeks involves not merely a free play of
feeling but&mdash;what is even more important&mdash;a free
play of the imagination. Feeling acquires a sort of infinitude
as a result of this coöperation of the imagination,
and so the romanticist goes, as we have seen, in quest of
the thrill superlative, as appears so clearly in his nympholepsy,
his pursuit of the “impossible she.” But the more
imaginative this quest for emotional happiness grows the
more it tends to become a mere nostalgia. Happiness is
achieved so far as it is achieved at all in dreamland. Rousseau
says of himself: <i>Mon plus constant bonheur fut en
songe</i>. Every finite satisfaction by the very fact that it is
finite leaves him unsatisfied. René says that he had exhausted
solitude as he had exhausted society: they had
both failed to satisfy his insatiable desires. René plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
takes his insatiableness to be the badge of his spiritual
distinction. To submit to any circumscribing of one’s desires
is to show that one has no sense of infinitude and
so to sink to the level of the philistine.</p>

<p>But does one become happy by being nostalgic and
hyperæsthetic, by burning with infinite indeterminate
desire? We have here perhaps the chief irony and contradiction
in the whole movement. The Rousseauist seeks
happiness and yet on his own showing, his mode of seeking
it results, not in happiness but in wretchedness. One
finds indeed figures in the nineteenth century, a Browning,
for example, who see in life first of all an emotional
adventure and then carry this adventure through to the
end with an apparently unflagging gusto. One may
affirm nevertheless that a movement which began by
asserting the goodness of man and the loveliness of nature
ended by producing the greatest literature of despair the
world has ever seen. No movement has perhaps been so
prolific of melancholy as emotional romanticism. To
follow it from Rousseau down to the present day is to
run through the whole gamut of gloom.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Infections of unutterable sadness,</div>
<div class="verse">Infections of incalculable madness,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Infections of incurable despair.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>According to a somewhat doubtful authority, Ninon
de Lenclos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> “the joy of the spirit measures its force.”
When the romanticist on the other hand discovers that
his ideal of happiness works put into actual unhappiness
he does not blame his ideal. He simply assumes that the
world is unworthy of a being so exquisitely organized as
himself, and so shrinks back from it and enfolds himself
in his sorrow as he would in a mantle. Since the superlative
bliss that he craves eludes him he will at least be
superlative in woe. So far from being a mark of failure
this woe measures his spiritual grandeur. “A great soul,”
as René says, “must contain more grief than a small
one.” The romantic poets enter into a veritable competition
with one another as to who shall be accounted the
most forlorn. The victor in this competition is awarded
the palm not merely for poetry but wisdom. In the
words of Arnold:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">Amongst us one</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Who most has suffered, takes dejectedly</div>
<div class="verse">His seat upon the intellectual throne;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And all his store of sad experience he</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Lays bare of wretched days.</div>
<div class="verse">Tells us his misery’s birth and growth and signs,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And how the dying spark of hope was fed,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And how the breast was soothed, and how the head,</div>
<div class="verse">And all his hourly varied anodynes.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This for our wisest! and we others pine,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And wish the long unhappy dream would end,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And waive all claim to bliss, and try to bear;</div>
<div class="verse">With close-lipped patience for our only friend,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Sad patience, too near neighbor to despair.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though Arnold may in this poem, as some one has
complained, reduce the muse to the rôle of hospital
nurse, he is, like his master Senancour, free from the
taint of theatricality. He does not as he said of Byron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
make “a pageant of his bleeding heart”; and the Byronic
pose has a close parallel in the pose of Chateaubriand.
An Irish girl at London once told Chateaubriand that “he
carried his heart in a sling.” He himself said that he had
a soul of the kind “the ancients called a sacred malady.”</p>

<p>Chateaubriand, to be sure, had his cheerful moments
and many of them. His sorrows he bestowed upon the
public. Herein he was a true child of Jean-Jacques. We are
told by eye-witnesses how heartily Rousseau enjoyed
many aspects of his life at Motiers-Travers. On his own
showing, he was plunged during this period in almost
unalloyed misery. Froude writes of Carlyle: “It was his
peculiarity that if matters were well with himself, it
never occurred to him that they could be going ill with
any one else; and, on the other hand, if he was uncomfortable,
he required everybody to be uncomfortable
along with him.” We can follow clear down to Gissing
the assumption in some form or other that “art must be
the mouthpiece of misery.” This whole question as to the
proper function of art goes to the root of the debate
between the classicist and the Rousseauist. “All these
poets,” Goethe complains to Eckermann of the romanticists
of 1830, “write as though they were ill, and as
though the whole world were a hospital. … Every one
of them in writing tries to be more desolate than all the
others. This is really an abuse of poetry which has been
given to make man satisfied with the world and with his
lot. But the present generation is afraid of all solid
energy; its mind is at ease and sees poetry only in weakness.
I have found a good expression to vex these gentlemen.
I am going to call their poetry hospital poetry.”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Goethe is here, like Chateaubriand, mocking to
some degree his own followers. When he suffered from a
spiritual ailment of any kind he got rid of it by inoculating
others with it; and it was in this way, as we learn from
his Autobiography, that he got relief from the <i>Weltschmerz</i>
of “Werther.” But later in life Goethe was classical
not merely in precept like Chateaubriand, but to some
extent in practice. The best of the poetry of his maturity
tends like that of the ancients to elevate and console.</p>

<p>The contrast between classic and romantic poetry in
this matter of melancholy is closely bound up with the
larger contrast between imitation and spontaneity.
Homer is the greatest of poets, according to Aristotle,
because he does not entertain us with his own person but
is more than any other poet an imitator. The romantic
poet writes, on the other hand, as Lamartine says he
wrote, solely for the “relief of his heart.” He pours forth
himself&mdash;his most intimate and private self; above all,
his anguish and his tears. In his relation to his reader, as
Musset tells us in a celebrated image,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> he is like the pelican
who rends and lacerates his own flesh to provide
nourishment for his young (<i>Pour toute nourriture il apporte
son cœur</i>):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Les plus désespérés sont les chants les plus beaux,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Et j’en sais d’immortels qui sont de purs sanglots.</i><a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To make of poetry a spontaneous overflow of powerful
emotion, usually of sorrowful emotion, is what the French
understand by lyricism (<i>le lyrisme</i>); and it may be objected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that it is not fair to compare an epic poet like
Homer with a lyricist like Musset. Let us then take for our
comparison the poet whom the ancients themselves looked
upon as the supreme type of the lyricist&mdash;Pindar. He
is superbly imaginative, “sailing,” as Gray tells us, “with
supreme dominion through the azure deep of air,” but
his imagination is not like that of Musset in the service
of sensibility. He does not bestow his own emotions upon
us but is rather in the Aristotelian sense an imitator. He
is indeed at the very opposite pole from Rousseau and
the “apostles of affliction.” “Let a man,” he says, “not
darken delight in his life.” “Disclose not to strangers our
burden of care; this at least shall I advise thee. Therefore
is it fitting to show openly to all the folk the fair and
pleasant things allotted us; but if any baneful misfortune
sent of heaven befalleth man, it is seemly to shroud this in
darkness.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> And one should also note Pindar’s hostility
towards that other great source of romantic lyricism&mdash;nostalgia
(“The desire of the moth for the star”), and
the closely allied pursuit of the strange and the exotic.
He tells of the condign punishment visited by Apollo upon
the girl Coronis who became enamoured of “a strange
man from Arcadia,” and adds: “She was in love with things
remote&mdash;that passion which many ere now have felt.
For among men, there is a foolish company of those
who, putting shame on what they have at home, cast
their glances afar, and pursue idle dreams in hopes that
shall not be fulfilled.”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>We are not to suppose that Pindar was that most tiresome
and superficial of all types&mdash;the professional optimist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
who insists on inflicting his “gladness” upon us.
“The immortals,” he says, “apportion to man two sorrows
for every boon they grant.”<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> In general the Greek
whom Kipling sings and whom we already find in Schiller&mdash;the
Greek who is an incarnation of the “joy of life
unquestioned, the everlasting wondersong of youth”<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>&mdash;is
a romantic myth. We read in the Iliad:<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> “Of all the
creatures that breathe or crawl upon the earth, none is
more wretched than man.” Here is the “joy of life unquestioned”
in Homer. Like Homer the best of the later
Greeks and Romans face unflinchingly the facts of life
and these facts do not encourage a thoughtless elation.
Their melancholy is even more concerned with the lot
of man in general than with their personal and private
grief. The quality of this melancholy is rendered in
Tennyson’s line on Virgil, one of the finest in nineteenth
century English poetry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Thou majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One should indeed not fail to distinguish between the
note of melancholy in a Homer or a Virgil and the melancholy
of the ancients, whether Stoic or Epicurean, who had
experienced the hopelessness and helplessness of a pure
naturalism in dealing with ultimate problems. The melancholy
of the Stoic is the melancholy of the man who associates
with the natural order a “virtue” that the natural
order does not give, and so is tempted to exclaim at last
with Brutus, that he had thought virtue a thing and had
found that it was only a word. The melancholy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Epicurean is that of the man who has tasted the bitter
sediment (<i>amari aliquid</i>) in the cup of pleasure. It is not
difficult to discover modern equivalents of both Stoic and
Epicurean melancholy. “One should seek,” says Sainte-Beuve,
“in the pleasures of René the secret of his <i>ennuis</i>,”
and so far as this is true Chateaubriand is on much the
same level as some Roman voluptuary who suffered from
the <i>tædium vitæ</i> in the time of Tiberius or Nero.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> But
though the Roman decadent gave himself up to the
pursuit of sensation and often of violent and abnormal
sensation he was less prone than a Chateaubriand to
associate this pursuit with the “infinite”; and so he was
less nostalgic and hyperæsthetic. His Epicureanism was
therefore less poetical no doubt, but on the other hand
he did not set up mere romantic restlessness as a sort of
substitute for religion. It was probably easier therefore
for him to feel the divine discontent and so turn to real
religion than it would have been if he had, like the
Rousseauist, complicated his Epicureanism with sham
spirituality.</p>

<p>To say that the melancholy even of the decadent
ancient is less nostalgic is perhaps only another way of
saying what I have said about the melancholy of the
ancients in general&mdash;that it is not so purely personal. It
derives less from his very private and personal illusions
and still less from his very private and personal disillusions.
In its purely personal quality romantic melancholy
is indeed inseparable from the whole conception of original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
genius. The genius sets out not merely to be unique
but unique in feeling, and the sense uniqueness in
feeling speedily passes over into that of uniqueness in
suffering&mdash;on the principle no doubt laid down by
Horace Walpole that life, which is a comedy for those
who think, is a tragedy for those who feel. To be a beautiful
soul, to preserve one’s native goodness of feeling among
men who have been perverted by society, is to be the elect
of nature and yet this election turns out as Rousseau tells
us to be a “fatal gift of heaven.” It is only the disillusioned
romanticist, however, who assumes this elegiac
tone. We need to consider what he means by happiness
while he still seeks for it in the actual world and not in
the <i>pays des chimères</i>. Rousseau tells us that he based the
sense of his own worth on the fineness of his powers of
perception. Why should nature have endowed him with
such exquisite faculties<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> if he was not to have a satisfaction
commensurate with them, if he was “to die without
having lived”? We have here the psychological origins
of the right to happiness that the romanticists were to
proclaim. “We spend on the passions,” says Joubert,
“the stuff that has been given us for happiness.” The
Rousseauist hopes to find his happiness in the passions
themselves. Romantic happiness does not involve any
moral effort and has been defined in its extreme forms as
a “monstrous dream of passive enjoyment.” Flaubert
has made a study of the right to happiness thus understood
in his “Madame Bovary.” Madame Bovary, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
very commonplace in other respects, feels exquisitely;
and inasmuch as her husband had no such fineness the
right to happiness meant for her, as it did for so many
other “misunderstood” women, the right to extra-marital
adventure. One should note the germs of melancholy
that lurk in the quest of the superlative moment
even if the quest is relatively successful. Suppose Saint-Preux
had succeeded in compressing into a single instant
“the delights of a thousand centuries”; and so far as
outer circumstances are concerned had had to pay no
penalty. The nearer the approach to a superhuman intensity
of feeling the greater is likely to be the ensuing
languor. The ordinary round of life seems pale and insipid
compared with the exquisite and fugitive moment. One
seems to one’s self to have drained the cup of life at a
draught and save perhaps for impassioned recollection
of the perfect moment to have no reason for continuing
to live. One’s heart is “empty and swollen”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and one is
haunted by thoughts of suicide.</p>

<p>This sense of having exhausted life<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and the accompanying
temptation to suicide that are such striking
features of the malady of the age are not necessarily associated
with any outer enjoyment at all. One may devour
life in revery and then the melancholy arises from the disproportion
between the dream and the fact. The revery
that thus consumes life in advance is not necessarily erotic.
What may be termed the cosmic revery of a Senancour or
an Amiel<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> has very much the same effect.</p>

<p>The atony and aridity of which the sufferer from romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
melancholy complains may have other sources
besides the depression that follows upon the achieving
of emotional intensity whether in revery or in fact; it may
also be an incident in the warfare between head and heart
that assumes so many forms among the spiritual posterity
of Jean-Jacques. The Rousseauist seeks happiness in
emotional spontaneity and this spontaneity seems to be
killed by the head which stands aloof and dissects and
analyzes. Perhaps the best picture of the emotionalist
who is thus incapacitated for a frank surrender to his own
emotions is the “Adolphe” of Benjamin Constant (a
book largely reminiscent of Constant’s actual affair with
Madame de Staël).</p>

<p>Whether the victim of romantic melancholy feels or
analyzes he is equally incapable of action. He who faces
resolutely the rude buffetings of the world is gradually
hardened against them. The romantic movement is filled
with the groans of those who have evaded action and at
the same time become highly sensitive and highly self-conscious.
The man who thrills more exquisitely to pleasure
than another will also thrill more exquisitely to pain;
nay, pleasure itself in its extreme is allied to pain;<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> so
that to be hyperæsthetic is not an unmixed advantage
especially if it be true, as Pindar says, that the Gods
bestow two trials on a man for every boon. Perhaps the
deepest bitterness is found, not in those who make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
pageant of their bleeding hearts, but in those who, like
Leconte de Lisle<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and others (<i>les impassibles</i>), disdain to
make a show of themselves to the mob, and so dissimulate
their quivering sensibility under an appearance of
impassibility; or, like Stendhal, under a mask of irony
that “is imperceptible to the vulgar.”</p>

<p>Stendhal aims not at emotional intensity only, but
also glorifies the lust for power. He did as much as any
one in his time to promote the ideal of the superman. Yet
even if the superman has nerves of steel, as seems to have
been the case with Stendhal’s favorite, Napoleon, and
acts on the outer world with a force of which the man in
search of a sensation is quite incapable, he does not act
upon himself, he remains ethically passive. This ethical
passivity is the trait common to all those who incline to
live purely on the naturalistic level&mdash;whether they sacrifice
the human law and its demands for measure to the
lust of knowledge or the lust of sensation or the lust of
power. The man who neglects his ethical self and withdraws
into his temperamental or private self, must
almost necessarily have the sense of isolation, of remoteness
from other men. We return here to the psychology
of the original genius to whom it was a tame and uninteresting
thing to be simply human and who, disdaining
to seem to others a being of the same clay as themselves,
wished to be in their eyes either an angel or a
demon&mdash;above all a demon.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> René does not, as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
said,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> want even the woman who loves him to feel at one
with him, but rather to be at once astonished and appalled.
He exercises upon those who approach him a malign fascination;
for he not only lives in misery himself as in his
natural element, but communicates this misery to those
who approach him. He is like one of those fair trees
under which one cannot sit without perishing. Moreover
René disavows all responsibility for thus being a
human Upas-tree. Moral effort is unavailing, for it was
all written in the book of fate. The victim of romantic
melancholy is at times tender and elegiac, at other
times he sets up as a heaven-defying Titan. This latter
pose became especially common in France around 1830
when the influence of Byron had been added to that of
Chateaubriand. Under the influence of these two writers
a whole generation of youth became “things of dark imaginings,”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
predestined to a blight that was at the same
time the badge of their superiority. One wished like René
to have an “immense, solitary and stormy soul,” and
also, like a Byronic hero, to have a diabolical glint in
the eye and a corpse-like complexion,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and so seem the
“blind and deaf agent of funereal mysteries.”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> “It was
possible to believe everything about René except the
truth.” The person who delights in being as mysterious
as this easily falls into mystification. Byron himself we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
are told was rather flattered by the rumor that he had
committed at least one murder. Baudelaire, it has been
said, displayed his moral gangrene as a warrior might
display honorable wounds. This flaunting of his own
perversity was part of the literary attitude he had inherited
from the “Satanic School.”</p>

<p>When the romanticist is not posing as the victim of fate
he poses as the victim of society. Both ways of dodging
moral responsibility enter into the romantic legend of the
<i>poète maudit</i>. Nobody loves a poet. His own mother
according to Baudelaire utters a malediction upon him.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
That is because the poet feels so exquisitely that he is at
once odious and unintelligible to the ordinary human
pachyderm. Inasmuch as the philistine is not too sensitive
to act he has a great advantage over the poet in the
real world and often succeeds in driving him from it and
indeed from life itself. This inferiority in action is a
proof of the poet’s ideality. “His gigantic wings,” as
Baudelaire says, “keep him from walking.” He has, in
Coleridgean phrase, fed on “honey dew and drunk the
milk of paradise,”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and so can scarcely be expected to
submit to a diet of plain prose. It is hardly necessary to
say that great poets of the past have not been at war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
with their public in this way. The reason is that they
were less taken up with the uttering of their own uniqueness;
they were, without ceasing to be themselves, servants
of the general sense.</p>

<p>Chatterton became for the romanticists a favorite
type of the <i>poète maudit</i>, and his suicide a symbol of the
inevitable defeat of the “ideal” by the “real.” The first
performance of Vigny’s Chatterton (1835) with its picture
of the implacable hatred of the philistine for the
artist was received by the romantic youth of Paris with
something akin to delirium. As Gautier says in his well-known
account of this performance one could almost hear
in the night the crack of the solitary pistols. The ordinary
man of letters, says Vigny in his preface to this play,
is sure of success, even the great writer may get a hearing,
but the poet, a being who is on a far higher level than
either, can look forward only to “perpetual martyrdom
and immolation.” He comes into the world to be a burden
to others; his native sensibility is so intimate and profound
that it “has plunged him from childhood into involuntary
ecstasies, interminable reveries, infinite inventions.
Imagination possesses him above all … it sweeps
his faculties heavenward as irresistibly as the balloon
carries up its car.” From that time forth he is more
or less cut off from normal contact with his fellow-men.
“His sensibility has become too keen; what only grazes
other men wounds him until he bleeds.” He is thrown back
more and more upon himself and becomes a sort of living
volcano, “consumed by secret ardors and inexplicable
languors,” and incapable of self-guidance. Such is the
poet. From his first appearance he is an outlaw. Let all
your tears and all your pity be for him. If he is finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
forced to suicide not he but society is to blame. He is like
the scorpion that cruel boys surround with live coals and
that is finally forced to turn his sting upon himself.
Society therefore owes it to itself to see that this exquisite
being is properly pensioned and protected by government,
to the end that idealism may not perish from the
earth. M. Thiers who was prime minister at that time is
said to have received a number of letters from young
poets, the general tenor of which was: “A position or I’ll
kill myself.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>A circumstance that should interest Americans is that
Poe as interpreted by Baudelaire came to hold for a later
generation of romanticists the place that Chatterton
had held for the romanticists of 1830. Poe was actually
murdered, says Baudelaire&mdash;and there is an element of
truth in the assertion along with much exaggeration&mdash;by
this great gas-lighted barbarity (i.e., America). All his
inner and spiritual life whether drunkard’s or poet’s, was
one constant effort to escape from this antipathetic
atmosphere “in which,” Baudelaire goes on to say, “the
impious love of liberty has given birth to a new tyranny,
the tyranny of the beasts, a zoöcracy”; and in this human
zoo a being with such a superhuman fineness of
sensibility as Poe was of course at a hopeless disadvantage.
In general our elation at Poe’s recognition in
Europe should be tempered by the reflection that this
recognition is usually taken as a point of departure for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
insulting America. Poe is about the only hyperæsthetic
romanticist we have had, and he therefore fell in with
the main European tendency that comes down from the
eighteenth century. Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, whom I have
already cited as an extreme example of romantic idealism,
was one of Poe’s avowed followers; but Villiers is
also related by his æsthetic and “diabolic” Catholicism
to Chateaubriand; and the religiosity of Chateaubriand
itself derives from the religiosity of Rousseau.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have been studying for the most part only
one main type of modern melancholy. This type even in
a Chateaubriand or a Byron and still more in their innumerable
followers may seem at once superficial and
theatrical. It often does not get beyond that Epicurean
toying with sorrow, that luxury of grief, which was not
unknown even to classical antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The despair of
Chateaubriand is frequently only a disguise of his love of
literary glory, and Chesterton is inclined to see in the
Byronic gloom an incident of youth and high spirits.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
But this is not the whole story even in Byron and Chateaubriand.
To find what is both genuine and distinctive
in romantic melancholy we need to enlarge a little further
on the underlying difference between the classicist and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the Rousseauist. The Rousseauist, as indeed the modern
man in general, is more preoccupied with his separate
and private self than the classicist. Modern melancholy
has practically always this touch of isolation not merely
because of the proneness of the “genius” to dwell on his
own uniqueness, but also because of the undermining of
the traditional communions by critical analysis. The
noblest form of the “malady of the age” is surely that
which supervened upon the loss of religious faith. This is
what distinguishes the sadness of an Arnold or a Senancour
from that of a Gray. The “Elegy” belongs to
the modern movement by the humanitarian note, the
sympathetic interest in the lowly, but in its melancholy
it does not go much beyond the milder forms of classical
meditation on the inevitable sadness of life&mdash;what one
may term pensiveness. Like the other productions of the
so-called graveyard school, it bears a direct relation to
Milton’s “Il Penseroso.” It is well to retain Gray’s own
distinction. “Mine is a white Melancholy, or rather
Leucocholy for the most part,” he wrote to Richard West
in 1742, “but there is another sort, black indeed, which
I have now and then felt.” Gray did not experience the
more poignant sadness, one may suspect, without some
loss of the “trembling hope” that is the final note of the
“Elegy.” No forlornness is greater than that of the man
who has known faith and then lost it. Renan writes of
his own break with the Church:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The fish of Lake Baikal, we are told, have spent thousands of years
in becoming fresh-water fish after being salt-water fish. I had to go
through my transition in a few weeks. Like an enchanted circle
Catholicism embraces the whole of life with so much strength that
when one is deprived of it everything seems insipid. I was terribly lost.
The universe produced upon me the impression of a cold and arid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
desert. For the moment that Christianity was not the truth, all the
rest appeared to me indifferent, frivolous, barely worthy of interest.
The collapse of my life upon itself left in me a feeling of emptiness like
that which follows an attack of fever or an unhappy love-affair.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The forlornness at the loss of faith is curiously combined
in many of the romanticists with the mood of
revolt. This type of romanticist heaps reproaches on a
God in whose existence he no longer believes (as in
Leconte de Lisle’s “Quaïn,” itself related to Byron’s
“Cain”). He shakes his fist at an empty heaven, or like
Alfred de Vigny (in his <i>Jardin des Oliviers</i>) assumes towards
this emptiness an attitude of proud disdain. He
is loath to give up this grandiose defiance of divinity if
only because it helps to save him from subsiding into
platitude. A somewhat similar mood appears in the
“Satanic” Catholics who continue to cling to religion
simply because it adds to the gusto of sinning.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> A Barbey
succeeded in combining the rôle of Byronic Titan with
that of champion of the Church. But in general the romantic
Prometheus spurns the traditional forms of communion
whether classical or Christian. He is so far as
everything established is concerned enormously centrifugal,
but he hopes to erect on the ruins of the past the
new religion of human brotherhood. Everything in this
movement from Shaftesbury down hinges on the rôle
that is thus assigned to sympathy: if it can really unite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
men who are at the same time indulging each to the
utmost his own “genius” or idiosyncrasy there is no
reason why one should not accept romanticism as a
philosophy of life.</p>

<p>But nowhere else perhaps is the clash more violent
between the theory and the fact. No movement is so
profuse in professions of brotherhood and none is so
filled with the aching sense of solitude. “Behold me then
alone upon the earth,” is the sentence with which Rousseau
begins his last book;<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and he goes on to marvel that
he, the “most loving of men,” had been forced more and
more into solitude. “I am in the world as though in a
strange planet upon which I have fallen from the one that
I inhabited.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> When no longer subordinated to something
higher than themselves both the head and the heart
(in the romantic sense) not only tend to be opposed to
one another, but also, each in its own way, to isolate.
Empedocles was used not only by Arnold but by other
victims<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> of romantic melancholy, as a symbol of intellectual
isolation: by his indulgence in the “imperious
lonely thinking power” Empedocles has broken the warm
bonds of sympathy with his fellows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">thou art</div>
<div class="verse">A living man no more, Empedocles!</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing but a devouring flame of thought,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">But a naked eternally restless mind!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His leaping into Ætna typifies his attempt to escape from
his loneliness by a fiery union with nature herself.</p>

<p>According to religion one should seek to unite with
a something that is set above both man and nature,
whether this something is called God as in Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
or simply the Law as in various philosophies of the Far
East.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The most severe penalty visited on the man who
transgresses is that he tends to fall away from this union.
This is the element of truth in the sentence of Diderot
that Rousseau took as a personal affront: “Only the
wicked man is alone.” Rousseau asserted in reply, anticipating
Mark Twain,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> that “on the contrary only the
good man is alone.” Now in a sense Rousseau is right.
“Most men are bad,” as one of the seven sages of Greece
remarked, and any one who sets out to follow a very
strenuous virtue is likely to have few companions on the
way. Rousseau is also right in a sense when he says that
the wicked man needs to live in society so that he may
have opportunity to practice his wickedness. Yet Rousseau
fails to face the main issue: solitude is above all a
psychic thing. A man may frequent his fellows and suffer
none the less acutely, like Poe’s “Man of the Crowd,”
from a ghastly isolation. And conversely one may be like
the ancient who said that he was never less alone than
when he was alone.</p>

<p>Hawthorne, who was himself a victim of solitude,
brooded a great deal on this whole problem, especially,
as may be seen in the “Scarlet Letter” and elsewhere,
on the isolating effects of sin. He perceived the relation
of the problem to the whole trend of religious life in New
England. The older Puritans had a sense of intimacy with
God and craved no other companionship. With the weakening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of their faith the later Puritans lost the sense of a
divine companionship, but retained their aloofness from
men. Hawthorne’s own solution of the problem of solitude,
so far as he offers any, is humanitarian. Quicken
your sympathies. Let the man who has taken as his
motto <i>Excelsior</i><a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> be warned. Nothing will console him
on the bleak heights either of knowledge or of power for
the warm contact with the dwellers in the valley. Faust,
who is a symbol of the solitude of knowledge, seeks to
escape from his forlornness by recovering this warm
contact. That the inordinate quest of power also leads to
solitude is beyond question. Napoleon, the very type of
the superman, must in the nature of the case have been
very solitary.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> His admirer Nietzsche wrote one day:
“I have forty-three years behind me and am as alone as
if I were a child.” Carlyle, whose “hero” derives like the
superman from the original genius<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> of the eighteenth
century, makes the following entry in his diary: “My
isolation, my feeling of loneliness, unlimitedness (much
meant by this) what tongue shall say? Alone, alone!”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot be granted, however, that one may escape
by love, as the Rousseauist understands the word, from
the loneliness that arises from the unlimited quest either
of knowledge or power. For Rousseauistic love is also unlimited
whether one understands by love either passion
or a diffusive sympathy for mankind at large. “What
solitudes are these human bodies,” Musset exclaimed
when fresh from his affair with George Sand. Wordsworth
cultivated a love for the lowly that quite overflowed the
bounds of neo-classic selection. It is a well-known fact
that the lowly did not altogether reciprocate. “A desolate-minded
man, ye kna,” said an old inn-keeper of the
Lakes to Canon Rawnsley, “’Twas potry as did it.” If
Wordsworth writes so poignantly of solitude one may infer
that it is because he himself had experienced it.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Nor
would it be difficult to show that the very philanthropic
Ruskin was at least as solitary as Carlyle with his tirades
against philanthropy.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the isolating effects of sin, but sin is
scarcely the right word to apply to most of the romanticists.
The solitude of which so many of them complain
does, however, imply a good deal of spiritual inertia.
Now to be spiritually inert, as I have said elsewhere,
is to be temperamental, to indulge unduly the lust for
knowledge or sensation or power without imposing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
these lusts some centre or principle of control set above
the ordinary self. The man who wishes to fly off on the
tangent of his own temperament and at the same time
enjoy communion on any except the purely material level
is harboring incompatible desires. For temperament is
what separates. A sense of unlimitedness (“much meant
by this” as Carlyle says) and of solitude are simply the
penalties visited upon the eccentric individualist. If we
are to unite on the higher levels with other men we must
look in another direction than the expansive outward
striving of temperament: we must in either the humanistic
or religious sense undergo conversion. We must pull
back our temperaments with reference to the model that
we are imitating, just as, in Aristotle’s phrase, one might
pull back and straighten out a crooked stick.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Usually
the brake on temperament is supplied by the ethos, the
convention of one’s age and country. I have tried to show
elsewhere that the whole programme of the eccentric
individualist is to get rid of this convention, whatever it
may be, without developing some new principle of control.
The eccentric individualist argues that to accept
control, to defer to some centre as the classicist demands,
is to cease to be himself. But are restrictions upon temperament
so fatal to a man’s being himself? The reply
hinges upon the definition of the word self, inasmuch as
man is a dual being. If a man is to escape from his isolation
he must, I have said, aim at some goal set above his
ordinary self which is at the same time his unique and
separate self. But because this goal is set above his ordinary
self, it is not therefore necessarily set above his total
personality. The limitations that he imposes on his ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
self may be the necessary condition of his entering
into possession of his ethical self, the self that he possesses
in common with other men. Aristotle says that if a
man wishes to achieve happiness he must be a true lover
of himself. It goes without saying that he means the
ethical self. The author of a recent book on Ibsen says
that Ibsen’s message to the world is summed up in the
line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">This above all,&mdash;to thine own self be true.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is abundantly plain from the context, however, that
Polonius is a decayed Aristotelian and not a precursor
of Ibsen. The self to which Aristotle would have a
man be true is at the opposite pole from the self that
Ibsen and the original geniuses are so eager to get uttered.</p>

<p>To impose the yoke of one’s human self upon one’s
temperamental self is, in the Aristotelian sense, to work.
Aristotle conceives of happiness in terms of work. All
types of temperamentalists, on the other hand, are from
the human point of view, passive. The happiness that
they crave is a passive happiness. A man may pursue
power with the energy of a Napoleon and yet remain ethically
passive. He may absorb whole encyclopædias and
remain ethically passive. He may expand his sympathies
until, like Schiller, he is ready to “bestow a kiss upon the
whole world” and yet remain ethically passive. A man
ceases to be ethically passive only when he begins to work
in the Aristotelian sense, that is when he begins to put
the brake on temperament and impulse, and in the same
degree he tends to become ethically efficient. By his
denial of the dualism of the spirit, Rousseau discredited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
this inner working, so that inwardness has come to seem
synonymous with mere subjectivity; and to be subjective
in the Rousseauistic sense is to be diffusive, to lack
purpose and concentration, to lose one’s self in a shoreless
sea of revery.</p>

<p>The utilitarian intervenes at this point and urges the
romanticist, since he has failed to work inwardly, at least
to work outwardly. Having missed the happiness of
ethical efficiency he may in this way find the happiness of
material efficiency, and at the same time serve the
world. This is the solution of the problem of happiness
that Goethe offers at the end of the Second Faust, and
we may affirm without hesitation that it is a sham solution.
To work outwardly and in the utilitarian sense,
without the inner working that can alone save from ethical
anarchy is to stimulate rather than repress the most
urgent of all the lusts&mdash;the lust of power. It is only
too plain that the unselective sympathy or joy in service
with which Goethe would complete Faust’s utilitarian
activity is not in itself a sufficient counterpoise to the
will to power, unless indeed we assume with Rousseau
that one may control expansive impulses by opposing
them to one another.</p>

<p>A terrible danger thus lurks in the whole modern programme:
it is a programme that makes for a formidable
mechanical efficiency and so tends to bring into an ever
closer material contact men who remain ethically centrifugal.
The reason why the humanitarian and other
schemes of communion that have been set up during the
last century have failed is that they do not, like the traditional
schemes, set any bounds to mere expansiveness,
or, if one prefers, they do not involve any conversion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
And so it is not surprising that the feeling of emptiness<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
or unlimitedness and isolation should be the special mark
of the melancholy of this period. René complains of his
“moral solitude”;<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> but strictly speaking his solitude is
the reverse of moral. Only by cultivating his human self
and by the unceasing effort that this cultivation involves
does a man escape from his nightmare of separateness
and so move in some measure towards happiness. But
the happiness of which René dreams is unethical&mdash;something
very private and personal and egoistic. Nothing
is easier than to draw the line from René to Baudelaire
and later decadents&mdash;for instance to Des Esseintes,
the hero of Huysmans’s novel “A Rebours,”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
who is typical of the last exaggerations of the movement.
Des Esseintes cuts himself off as completely as possible
from other men and in the artificial paradise he has
devised gives himself up to the quest of strange and
violent sensation; but his dream of happiness along
egoistic lines turns into a nightmare,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> his palace of art
becomes a hell. Lemaître is quite justified in saying of
Des Esseintes that he is only René or Werther brought
up to date&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>“a played-out and broken-down Werther
who has a malady of the nerves, a deranged stomach and
eighty years more of literature to the bad.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Emotional romanticism was headed from the start
towards this bankruptcy because of its substitution for
ethical effort of a mere lazy floating on the stream of
mood and temperament. I have said that Buddhism saw
in this ethical indolence the root of all evil. Christianity
in its great days was preoccupied with the same problem.
To make this point clear it will be necessary to add
to what I have said about classical and romantic melancholy
a few words about melancholy in the Middle Ages.
In a celebrated chapter of his “Genius of Christianity”
(<i>Le Vague des passions</i>) Chateaubriand seeks to give
to the malady of the age Christian and mediæval origins.
This was his pretext, indeed, for introducing René into
an apology for Christianity and so, as Sainte-Beuve
complained, administering poison in a sacred wafer.
Chateaubriand begins by saying that the modern man
is melancholy because, without having had experience
himself, he is at the same time overwhelmed by the
second-hand experience that has been heaped up in the
books and other records of an advanced civilization; and
so he suffers from a precocious disillusion; he has the
sense of having exhausted life before he has enjoyed it.
There is nothing specifically Christian in this disillusion
and above all nothing mediæval. But Chateaubriand
goes on to say that from the decay of the pagan world
and the barbarian invasions the human spirit received
an impression of sadness and possibly a tinge of misanthropy
which has never been completely effaced. Those
that were thus wounded and estranged from their fellow-men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
took refuge formerly in monasteries, but now that
this resource has failed them, they are left in the world
without being of it and so they “become the prey of a
thousand chimeras.” Then is seen the rise of that guilty
melancholy which the passions engender when, left
without definite object, they prey upon themselves in a
solitary heart.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>The <i>vague des passions</i>, the expansion of infinite indeterminate
desire, that Chateaubriand here describes
may very well be related to certain sides of Christianity&mdash;especially
to what may be termed its neo-Platonic side.
Yet Christianity at its best has shown itself a genuine
religion, in other words, it has dealt sternly and veraciously
with the facts of human nature. It has perceived
clearly how a man may move towards happiness and
how on the other hand he tends to sink into despair; or
what amounts to the same thing, it has seen the supreme
importance of spiritual effort and the supreme danger of
spiritual sloth. The man who looked on himself as cut off
from God and so ceased to strive was according to the
mediæval Christian the victim of <i>acedia</i>. This sluggishness
and slackness of spirit, this mere drifting and abdication
of will, may, as Chaucer’s parson suggests, be the
crime against the Holy Ghost itself. It would in fact not
be hard to show that what was taken by the Rousseauist
to be the badge of spiritual distinction was held by the
mediæval Christian to be the chief of all the deadly sins.</p>

<p>The victim of <i>acedia</i> often looked upon himself, like
the victim of the malady of the age, as foredoomed. But
though the idea of fate enters at times into mediæval
melancholy, the man of the Middle Ages could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
so detach himself from the community as to suffer from
that sense of loneliness which is the main symptom of
romantic melancholy. This forlornness was due not
merely to the abrupt disappearance of the older forms
of communion, but to the failure of the new attempts at
communion. When one gets beneath the surface of the
nineteenth century one finds that it was above all a
period of violent disillusions, and it is especially after
violent disillusion that a man feels himself solitary and
forlorn. I have said that the special mark of the half-educated
man is his harboring of incompatible desires.
The new religions or unifications of life that appeared
during the nineteenth century made an especially strong
appeal to the half-educated man because it seemed to
him that by accepting some one of these he could enjoy
the benefits of communion and at the same time not have
to take on the yoke of any serious discipline; that he
could, in the language of religion, achieve salvation without
conversion. When a communion on these lines turns
out to be not a reality, but a sham, and its disillusioned
votary feels solitary and forlorn, he is ready to blame
everybody and everything except himself.</p>

<p>A few specific illustrations will help us to understand
how romantic solitude, which was created by the weakening
of the traditional communions, was enhanced by
the collapse of various sham communions. Let us return
for a moment to that eminent example of romantic melancholy
and disillusion, Alfred de Vigny. His “Chatterton”
deals with the fatal misunderstanding of the original
genius by other men. “Moïse” deals more specifically
with the problem of his solitude. The genius is so eminent
and unique, says Vigny, speaking for himself from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
behind the mask of the Hebrew prophet, that he is quite
cut off from ordinary folk who feel that they have nothing
in common with him.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> This forlornness of the genius
is not the sign of some capital error in his philosophy.
On the contrary it is the sign of his divine election, and
so Moses blames God for his failure to find happiness.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
If the genius is cut off from communion with men he
cannot hope for companionship with God because he has
grown too sceptical. Heaven is empty and in any case
dumb; and so in the poem to which I have already referred
(<i>Le Mont des Oliviers</i>) Vigny assumes the mask of
Jesus himself to express this desolateness, and concludes
that the just man will oppose a haughty and Stoic disdain
to the divine silence.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>All that is left for the genius is to retire into his ivory
tower&mdash;a phrase appropriately applied for the first time
to Vigny.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> In the ivory tower he can at least commune
with nature and the ideal woman. But Vigny came at a
time when the Arcadian glamour was being dissipated
from nature. Partly under scientific influence she was
coming to seem not a benign but a cold and impassive
power, a collection of cruel and inexorable laws. I have
already mentioned this mood that might be further illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
from Taine and so many others towards the middle
of the nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> “I am called a ‘mother,’”
Vigny makes Nature say, “and I am a tomb.”<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> (“La
Maison du Berger”); and so in the <i>Maison roulante</i>, or
sort of Arcadia on wheels that he has imagined, he must
seek his chief solace with the ideal feminine companion.
But woman herself turns out to be treacherous; and,
assuming the mask of Samson (“La Colère de Samson”),
Vigny utters a solemn malediction upon the eternal
Delilah (<i>Et, plus ou moins, la Femme est toujours Dalila</i>).
Such is the disillusion that comes from having sought an
ideal communion in a liaison with a Parisian actress.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>Now that every form of communion has failed, all that
is left it would seem is to die in silence and solitude like
the wolf (“La Mort du Loup”). Vigny continues to hold,
however, like the author of the “City of Dreadful
Night,” that though men may not meet in their joys,
they may commune after a fashion in their woe. He
opposes to heartless nature and her “vain splendors” the
religion of pity, “the majesty of human sufferings.”<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
Towards the end when Vigny feels the growing prestige of
science, he holds out the hope that a man may to a certain
extent escape from the solitude of his own ego into
some larger whole by contributing his mite to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> “progress.”
But the symbol of this communion<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> that he has chosen&mdash;that
of the shipwrecked and sinking mariner who consigns
his geographical discoveries to a bottle in the hope
that it may be washed up on some civilized shore&mdash;is itself
of a singular forlornness.</p>

<p>Vigny has a concentration and power of philosophical
reflection that is rare among the romanticists. George
Sand is inferior to him in this respect but she had a richer
and more generous nature, and is perhaps even more instructive
in her life and writings for the student of romantic
melancholy. After the loss of the religious faith of
her childhood she became an avowed Rousseauist. She
attacks a society that seems to her to stand in the way of
the happiness of which she dreams&mdash;the supreme emotional
intensity to be achieved in an ideal love. In celebrating
passion and the rights of passion she is lyrical in
the two main modes of the Rousseauist&mdash;she is either
tender and elegiac, or else stormy and Titanic. But when
she attempts to practice with Musset this religion of love,
the result is violent disillusion. In the forlornness that
follows upon the collapse of her sham communion she
meditates suicide. “Ten years ago,” she wrote in 1845 to
Mazzini, “I was in Switzerland; I was still in the age of
tempests; I made up my mind even then to meet you, if
I should resist the temptation to suicide which pursued
me upon the glaciers.” And then gradually a new faith
dawned upon her; she substituted for the religion of love
the religion of human brotherhood. She set up as an
object of worship humanity in its future progress; and
then, like so many other dreamers, she suffered a violent
disillusion in the Revolution of 1848. The radiant abstraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
she had been worshipping had been put to the
test and she discovered that there entered into the actual
make-up of the humanity she had so idealized “a large
number of knaves, a very large number of lunatics, and
an immense number of fools.” What is noteworthy in
George Sand is that she not only saved the precious principle
of faith from these repeated shipwrecks but towards
the end of her life began to put it on a firmer footing. Like
Goethe she worked out to some extent, in opposition to
romanticism, a genuinely ethical point of view.</p>

<p>This latter development can best be studied in her
correspondence with Flaubert. She urges him to exercise
his will, and he replies that he is as “fatalistic as a Turk.”
His fatalism, however, was not oriental but scientific or
pseudo-scientific. I have already cited his demand that
man be studied “objectively” just as one would study
“a mastodon or a crocodile.” Flaubert refused to see any
connection between this determinism and his own gloom
or between George Sand’s assertion of will and her cheerfulness.
It was simply, he held, a matter of temperament,
and there is no doubt some truth in this contention.
“You at the first leap mount to heaven,” he says, “while
I, poor devil, am glued to the earth as though by leaden
soles.” And again: “In spite of your great sphinx eyes
you have always seen the world as through a golden
mist,” whereas “I am constantly dissecting; and when
I have finally discovered the corruption in anything
that is supposed to be pure, the gangrene in its fairest
parts, then I raise my head and laugh.” Yet George
Sand’s cheerfulness is also related to her perception of a
power in man to work upon himself&mdash;a power that sets
him apart from other animals. To enter into this region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of ethical effort is to escape from the whole fatal circle
of naturalism, and at the same time to show some capacity
to mature&mdash;a rare achievement among the romanticists.
The contrast is striking here between George
Sand and Hugo, who, as the ripe fruit of his meditations,
yields nothing better than the apotheosis of Robespierre
and Marat. “I wish to see man as he is,” she writes to
Flaubert. “He is not good or bad: he is good and bad.
But he is something else besides: being good and bad he
has an inner force which leads him to be very bad and a
little good, or very good and a little bad. I have often
wondered,” she adds, “why your ‘Education Sentimentale’
was so ill received by the public, and the reason, as
it seems to me, is that its characters are passive&mdash;that
they do not act upon themselves.” But the Titaness of
the period of “Lélia” can scarcely be said to have acted
upon herself, so that she is justified in writing: “I cannot
forget that my personal victory over despair is the work
of my will, and of a new way of understanding life which
is the exact opposite of the one I held formerly.” How
different is the weary cry of Flaubert: “I am like a piece
of clock work, what I am doing to-day I shall be doing
to-morrow; I did exactly the same thing yesterday; I
was exactly the same man ten years ago.”</p>

<p>The correspondence of Flaubert and George Sand
bears interestingly on another of the sham religions of
the nineteenth century&mdash;the religion of art. Art is for
Flaubert not merely a religion but a fanaticism. He
preaches abstinence, renunciation and mortification of
the flesh in the name of art. He excommunicates those
who depart from artistic orthodoxy and speaks of heretics
and disbelievers in art with a ferocity worthy of a Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
inquisitor. Ethical beauty such as one finds in the
Greeks at their best resides in order and proportion; it is
not a thing apart but the outcome of some harmonious
whole. Beauty in the purely æsthetic and unethical
sense that Flaubert gives to the word is little more than
the pursuit of illusion. The man who thus treats beauty
as a thing apart, who does not refer back his quest of the
exquisite to some ethical centre will spend his life Ixion-like
embracing phantoms. “O Art, Art,” exclaims Flaubert,
“bitter deception, nameless phantom, which gleams
and lures us to our ruin!” He speaks elsewhere of “the
chimera of style which is wearing him out soul and body.”
Attaching as he did an almost religious importance to his
quest of the exquisite he became like so many other
Rousseauists not merely æsthetic but hyperæsthetic. He
complains in his old age: “My sensibility is sharper than
a razor’s edge; the creaking of a door, the face of a
bourgeois, an absurd statement set my heart to throbbing
and completely upset me.” Hardly anywhere else,
indeed, will one find such accents of bitterness, such
melancholy welling up unbidden from the very depths of
the heart, as in the devotees of art for art’s sake&mdash;Flaubert,
Leconte de Lisle, Théophile Gautier.</p>

<p>George Sand takes Flaubert to task with admirable
tact for his failure to subordinate art to something higher
than itself. “Talent imposes duties; and art for art’s sake
is an empty word.” As she grew older she says she came
more and more to put truth above beauty, and goodness
before strength. “I have reflected a great deal on what
is <i>true</i>, and in this search for truth, the sentiment of
my ego has gradually disappeared.” The truth on which
she had reflected was what she herself calls total truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
(<i>le vrai total</i>), not merely truth according to the natural
law, which received such exclusive emphasis towards the
middle of the nineteenth century as to lead to the rise of
another sham religion&mdash;the religion of science. “You
have a better sense for total truth,” she tells one of her
correspondents “than Sainte-Beuve, Renan and Littré.
They have fallen into the German rut: therein lies their
weakness.” And Flaubert writes to George Sand: “What
amazes and delights me is the strength of your whole
personality, not that of the brain alone.”</p>

<p>Furthermore the holding of the human law that made
possible this rounded development, this growth towards
total truth, was a matter not of tradition but of immediate
perception. George Sand had succeeded, as Taine
says, in making the difficult transition from an hereditary
faith to a personal conviction. Now this perception of the
human law is something very different from the pantheistic
revery in which George Sand was also an adept. To
look on revery as the equivalent of vision in the Aristotelian
sense, as Rousseau and so many of his followers have
done, is to fall into sham spirituality. Maurice de Guérin
falls into sham spirituality when he exclaims “Oh! this
contact of nature and the soul would engender an ineffable
voluptuousness, a prodigious love of heaven and
of God.” I am not asserting that George Sand herself
discriminated sharply between ethical and æsthetic
perception or that she is to be rated as a very great sage
at any time. Yet she owes her recovery of serenity after
suffering shock upon shock of disillusion to her having
exercised in some degree what she terms “the contemplative
sense wherein resides invincible faith” (<i>le sens
contemplatif où réside la foi invincible</i>), and the passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
that bear witness to her use of this well-nigh obsolete
sense are found in her correspondence.</p>

<p>Wordsworth lauds in true Rousseauistic fashion a
“wise passiveness.” But to be truly contemplative is not
to be passive at all, but to be “energetic” in Aristotle’s
sense, or strenuous in Buddha’s sense. It is a matter of
no small import that the master analyst of the East and
the master analyst of the West are at one in their solution
of the supreme problem of ethics&mdash;the problem of happiness.
For there can be no doubt that the energy<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> in which
the doctrine of Aristotle culminates is the same as the
“strenuousness”<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> on which Buddha puts his final emphasis.
The highest good they both agree is a contemplative
<i>working</i>. It is by thus working according to the
human law that one rises above the naturalistic level.
The scientific rationalists of the nineteenth century left
no place for this true human spontaneity when they
sought to subject man entirely to the “law for thing.”
This scientific determinism was responsible for a great
deal of spiritual depression and <i>acedia</i>, especially in
France during the second half of the nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
But even if science is less dogmatic and absolute one
needs to consider why it does not deserve to be given the
supreme and central place in life, why it cannot in short
take the place of humanism and religion, and the working
according to the human law that they both enjoin.</p>

<p>A man may indeed effect through science a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
escape from himself, and this is very salutary so far as it
goes; he has to discipline himself to an order that is quite
independent of his own fancies and emotions. He becomes
objective in short, but objective according to the
natural and not according to the human law. Objectivity
of this kind gives control over natural forces but it does
not supply the purpose for which these forces are to be
used. It gives the airship, for instance, but does not determine
whether the airship is to go on some beneficent
errand or is to scatter bombs on women and children.
Science does not even set right limits to the faculty that
it chiefly exercises&mdash;the intellect. In itself it stimulates
rather than curbs one of the three main lusts to which
human nature is subject&mdash;the lust of knowledge. Renan,
who makes a religion of science, speaks of “sacred curiosity.”
But this is even more dangerous than the opposite
excess of the ascetic Christian who denounces all curiosity
as vain. The man of science avers indeed that he does
subordinate his knowledge to an adequate aim, namely
the progress of humanity. But the humanity of the
Baconian is only an intellectual abstraction just as the
humanity of the Rousseauist is only an emotional dream.
George Sand found, as we have seen, that the passage
from one’s dream of humanity to humanity in the concrete
involved a certain disillusion. The scientific or
rationalistic humanitarian is subject to similar disillusions.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
Science not only fails to set proper limits to the
activity of the intellect, but one must also note a curious
paradox in its relation to the second of the main lusts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
to which man is subject, the lust for emotion (<i>libido
sentiendi</i>). The prime virtue of science is to be unemotional
and at the same time keenly analytical. Now
protracted and unemotional analysis finally creates a
desire, as Renan says, for the opposite pole, “the kisses
of the naïve being,” and in general for a frank surrender
to the emotions. Science thus actually prepares clients for
the Rousseauist.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The man of science is also flattered by
the Rousseauistic notion that conscience and virtue are
themselves only forms of emotion. He is thus saved from
anything so distasteful as having to subordinate his own
scientific discipline to some superior religious or humanistic
discipline. He often oscillates between the rationalistic
and the emotional pole not only in other things but
also in his cult of humanity. But if conscience is merely an
emotion there is a cult that makes a more potent appeal
to conscience than the cult of humanity itself and that is
the cult of country. One is here at the root of the most
dangerous of all the sham religions of the modern age&mdash;the
religion of country, the frenzied nationalism that is
now threatening to make an end of civilization itself.</p>

<p>Both emotional nationalism and emotional internationalism
go back to Rousseau, but in his final emphasis
he is an emotional nationalist;<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> and that is because he
saw that patriotic “virtue” is a more potent intoxicant
than the love of humanity. The demonstration came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the French Revolution which began as a great international
movement on emotional lines and ended in imperialism
and Napoleon Bonaparte. It is here that the terrible
peril of a science that is pursued as an end in itself becomes
manifest. It disciplines man and makes him efficient
on the naturalistic level, but leaves him ethically
undisciplined. Now in the absence of ethical discipline
the lust for knowledge and the lust for feeling count very
little, at least practically, compared with the third main
lust of human nature&mdash;the lust for power. Hence the
emergence of that most sinister of all types, the efficient
megalomaniac. The final use of a science that has thus
become a tool of the lust for power is in Burke’s phrase
to “improve the mystery of murder.”</p>

<p>This union of material efficiency and ethical unrestraint,
though in a way the upshot of the whole movement
we have been studying, is especially marked in the
modern German. Goethe as I have pointed out is ready
to pardon Faust for grave violations of the moral law
because of work which, so far from being ethical, is, in
view of the ruin in which it involves the rustic pair,
Baucis and Philemon, under suspicion of being positively
unethical. Yet Goethe was far from being a pure utilitarian
and he had reacted more than most Germans of his
time from Rousseauism. Rousseau is glorified by Germans
as a chief source of their <i>Kultur</i>, as I have already
pointed out. Now <i>Kultur</i> when analyzed breaks up into
two very different things&mdash;scientific efficiency and emotionalism
or what the Germans (and unfortunately not
the Germans alone) term “idealism.” There is no question
about the relation of this idealism to the stream of
tendency of which Rousseau is the chief representative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
By his corruption of conscience Rousseau made it possible
to identify character with temperament. It was easy
for Fichte and others to take the next step and identify
national character with national temperament. The
Germans according to Fichte are all beautiful souls, the
elect of nature. If they have no special word for character
it is because to be a German and have character are
synonymous. Character is something that gushes up
from the primordial depths of the German’s being without
any conscious effort on his part.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The members of
a whole national group may thus flatter one another and
inbreed their national “genius” in the romantic sense,
and feel all the while that they are ecstatic “idealists”;
yet as a result of the failure to refer their genius back
to some ethical centre, to work, in other words, according
to the human law, they may, so far as the members
of other national groups are concerned, remain in a state
of moral solitude.</p>

<p>Everything thus hinges on the meaning of the word
work. In the abstract and metaphysical sense man can
know nothing of unity. He may, however, by working
in the human sense, by imposing, that is, due limits on
his expansive desires, close up in some measure the gap
in his own nature (the “civil war in the cave”) and so
tend to become inwardly one. He may hope in the same
way to escape from the solitude of his own ego, for the
inner unity that he achieves through work is only an
entering into possession of his ethical self, the self that
he possesses in common with other men. Thus to work
ethically is not only to become more unified and happy
but also to move away from what is less permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
towards what is more permanent and therefore more
peaceful in his total nature; so that the problem of happiness
and the problem of peace turn out at last to be
inseparable.</p>

<p>Souls, says Emerson, never meet; and it is true that a
man never quite escapes from his solitude. That does not
make the choice of direction any the less important. An
infinite beckons to him on either hand. The one inspires
the divine discontent, the other romantic restlessness.
If instead of following the romantic lure he heeds the call
from the opposite direction, he will not indeed attain to
any perfect communion but he will be less solitary.
Strictly speaking a man is never happy in the sense of
being completely satisfied with the passing moment,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> or
never, Dr. Johnson would add, except when he is drunk.
The happiness of the sober and waking man resides, it
may be, not in his content with the present moment but
in the very effort that marks his passage from a lower to
a higher ethical level.</p>

<p>The happiness of which Rousseau dreamed, it has been
made plain, was not this active and ethical happiness, but
rather the passive enjoyment of the beautiful moment&mdash;the
moment that he would like to have last forever. After
seeking for the beautiful moment in the intoxication of
love, he turned as we have seen to pantheistic revery.
“As long as it lasts,” he says of a moment of this kind,
“one is self-sufficing like God.” Yes, but it does not last,
and when he wakes from his dream of communion with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
nature, he is still solitary, still the prisoner of his ego.
The pantheistic dreamer is passive in every sense. He is
not working either according to the human or according
to the natural law, and so is not gaining either in material
or in ethical efficiency. In a world such as that in which
we live this seems too much like picnicking on a battlefield.
Rousseau could on occasion speak shrewdly on this
point. He wrote to a youthful enthusiast who wished to
come and live with him at Montmorency: “The first bit
of advice I should like to give you is not to indulge in the
taste you say you have for the contemplative life and
which is only an indolence of the spirit reprehensible at
every age and especially at yours. Man is not made to
meditate but to act.”</p>

<p>The contemplative life is then, according to Rousseau,
the opposite of action. But to contemplate is according
to an Aristotle or a Buddha to engage in the most important
form of action, the form that leads to happiness.
To identify leisure and the contemplative life with pantheistic
revery, as Rousseau does, is to fall into one of the
most vicious of confusions. Perhaps indeed the most important
contrast one can reach in a subject of this kind
is that between a wise strenuousness and a more or less
wise passiveness, between the spiritual athlete and the
cosmic loafer, between a Saint Paul, let us say, and a
Walt Whitman.</p>

<p>The spiritual idling and drifting of the Rousseauist
would be less sinister if it did not coexist in the world of
to-day with an intense material activity. The man who
seeks happiness by work according to the natural law is
to be rated higher than the man who seeks happiness in
some form of emotional intoxication (including pantheistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
revery). He is not left unarmed, a helpless dreamer in
the battle of life. The type of efficiency he is acquiring
also helps him to keep at bay man’s great enemy, ennui.
An Edison, we may suppose, who is drawn ever onward
by the lure of wonder and curiosity and power, has little
time to be bored. It is surely better to escape from the
boredom of life after the fashion of Edison than after the
fashion of Baudelaire.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>I have already pointed out, however, the peril in a
one-sided working of this kind. It makes man efficient
without making him ethical. It stimulates rather than
corrects a fearless, formless expansion on the human
level. This inordinate reaching out beyond bounds is, as
the great Greek poets saw with such clearness, an invitation
to Nemesis. The misery that results from unrestraint,
from failure to work according to the human law,
is something different from mere pain and far more to be
dreaded; just as the happiness that results from a right
working according to the human law is something different
from mere pleasure and far more worthy of pursuit.</p>

<p>The present alliance between emotional romanticists
and utilitarians<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> is a veritable menace to civilization itself.
It does not follow, as I said in a previous chapter,
because revery or “intuition of the creative flux” cannot
take the place of leisure or meditation, that one must
therefore condemn it utterly. It may like other forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
romanticism have a place on the recreative side of life.
What finally counts is work according to either the human
or the natural law, but man cannot always be working.
He needs moments of relief from tension and concentration
and even, it should seem, of semi-oblivion of
his conscious self. As one of the ways of winning such moments
of relaxation and partial forgetfulness much may
be said for revery. In general one must grant the solace
and rich source of poetry that is found in communion
with nature even though the final emphasis be put on
communion with man. It is no small thing to be, as
Arnold says Wordsworth was, a “priest of the wonder
and bloom of the world.” One cannot however grant the
Wordsworthian that to be a priest of wonder is necessarily
to be also a priest of wisdom. Thus to promote to
the supreme and central place something that is legitimate
in its own degree, but secondary, is to risk starting
a sham religion.</p>

<p>Those who have sought to set up a cult of love or
beauty or science or humanity or country are open to
the same objections as the votaries of nature. However
important each of these things may be in its own place, it
cannot properly be put in the supreme and central place
for the simple reason that it does not involve any adequate
conversion or discipline of man’s ordinary self to
some ethical centre. I have tried to show that the sense of
solitude or forlornness that is so striking a feature of
romantic melancholy arises not only from a loss of hold
on the traditional centres, but also from the failure of
these new attempts at communion to keep their promises.
The number of discomfitures of this kind in the
period that has elapsed since the late eighteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
suggests that this period was even more than most
periods an age of sophistry. Every age has had its false
teachers, but possibly no age ever had so many dubious
moralists as this, an incomparable series of false prophets
from Rousseau himself down to Nietzsche and Tolstoy.
It remains to sum up in a closing chapter the results of
my whole inquiry and at the same time to discuss somewhat
more specifically the bearing of my whole point of
view, especially the idea of work according to the human
law, upon the present situation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PRESENT OUTLOOK</span></h2>

<p>It has been my endeavor throughout this book to show
that classic and romantic art, though both at their best
highly imaginative, differ in the quality of the imagination.
I pointed out in my first chapter that in his recoil
from the intellectual romanticism of the Renaissance and
the mediæval romanticism of actual adventure the neo-classicist
came to rest his literary faith on “reason” (by
which he meant either ordinary good sense or abstract
reasoning), and then opposed this reason or judgment to
imagination. This supposed opposition between reason
and imagination was accepted by the romantic rebels
against neo-classicism and has been an endless source
of confusion to the present day. Though both neo-classicists
and romanticists achieved much admirable work,
work which is likely to have a permanent appeal, it is
surely no small matter that they both failed on the
whole to deal adequately with the imagination and its rôle
whether in literature or life. Thus Dryden attributes the
immortality of the Æneid to its being “a well-weighed
judicious poem. Whereas poems which are produced
by the vigor of imagination only have a gloss upon
them at the first which time wears off, the works of judgment
are like the diamond; the more they are polished,
the more lustre they receive.”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Read on and you will find
that Dryden thus stresses judgment by way of protest
against the Cavalier Marini and the imaginative unrestraint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that he and other intellectual romanticists display.
Dryden thus obscures the fact that what gives the
immortalizing touch to the Æneid is not mere judgment
but imagination&mdash;a certain quality of imagination.
Even the reader who is to enter properly into the spirit
of Virgil needs more than judgment&mdash;he needs to possess
in some measure the same quality of imagination.
The romantic answer to the neo-classic distrust of the
imagination was the apotheosis of the imagination, but
without sufficient discrimination as to its quality, and
this led only too often to an anarchy of the imagination&mdash;an
anarchy associated, as we have seen, in the case of
the Rousseauist, with emotion rather than with thought
or action.</p>

<p>The modern world has thus tended to oscillate between
extremes in its attitude towards the imagination,
so that we still have to turn to ancient Greece for the best
examples of works in which the imagination is at once
disciplined and supreme. Aristotle, I pointed out, is
doing little more than give an account of this Greek
practice when he says that the poet ranks higher than
the historian because he achieves a more general truth,
but that he can achieve this more general truth only by
being a master of illusion. Art in which the illusion is
not disciplined to the higher reality counts at best on
the recreative side of life. “Imagination,” says Poe, “feeling
herself for once unshackled, roamed at will among
the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable
land.”<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> To take seriously the creations of this type of
imagination is to be on the way towards madness. Every
madhouse, indeed, has inmates who are very imaginative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
in the fashion Poe here describes. We must not
confuse the concentric or ethical with the eccentric imagination
if we are to define rightly the terms classic and
romantic or indeed to attain to sound criticism at all.
My whole aim has been to show that a main stream of
emotional sophistry that takes its rise in the eighteenth
century and flows down through the nineteenth involves
just such a confusion.</p>

<p>The general distinction between the two types of
imagination would seem sufficiently clear. To apply the
distinction concretely is, it must be admitted, a task
infinitely difficult and delicate, a task that calls for the
utmost degree of the <i>esprit de finesse</i>. In any particular
case there enters an element of vital novelty. The relation
of this vital novelty to the ethical or permanent element
in life is something that cannot be determined by any
process of abstract reasoning or by any rule of thumb;
it is a matter of immediate perception. The art of the
critic is thus hedged about with peculiar difficulties. It
does not follow that Aristotle himself because he has laid
down sound principles in his Poetics, would always have
been right in applying them. Our evidence on this point
is as a matter of fact somewhat scanty.</p>

<p>Having thus admitted the difficulty of the undertaking
we may ourselves attempt a few concrete illustrations of
how sound critical standards tended to suffer in connection
with the romantic movement. Leaving aside for the
moment certain larger aspects of the ethical imagination
that I am going to discuss presently, let us confine ourselves
to poetry. Inasmuch as the ethical imagination
does not in itself give poetry but wisdom, various cases
may evidently arise: a man may be wise without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
poetical; he may be poetical without being wise; he may
be both wise and poetical.</p>

<p>We may take as an example of the person who was
wise without being poetical Dr. Johnson. Though most
persons would grant that Dr. Johnson was not poetical,
it is well to remember that this generalization has only
the approximate truth that a literary generalization can
have. The lines on Levet have been inserted and rightly
in anthologies. If not on the whole poetical, Johnson
was, as Boswell says, eminently fitted to be a “majestic
teacher of moral and religious wisdom.” Few men
have had a firmer grasp on the moral law or been freer
from the various forms of sophistry that tend to obscure
it. Unlike Socrates, however, of whom he reminds
us at times by his ethical realism, Johnson rests his insight
not on a positive but on a traditional basis. To say
that Johnson was truly religious is only another way of
saying that he was truly humble, and one of the reasons
for his humility was his perception of the ease with which
illusion in man passes over into delusion, and even into
madness. His chapter on the “Dangerous Prevalence of
Imagination” in “Rasselas” not only gives the key to
that work but to much else in his writings. What he
opposes to this dangerous prevalence of imagination is
not a different type of imagination but the usual neo-classical
reason or judgment or “sober probability.” His
defence of wisdom against the gathering naturalistic sophistries
of his time is therefore somewhat lacking in
imaginative prestige. He seemed to be opposing innovation
on purely formalistic and traditional grounds in an
age which was more and more resolutely untraditional
and which was determined above all to emancipate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
imagination from its strait-jacket of formalism. Keats
would not have hesitated to rank Johnson among those
who “blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face.”</p>

<p>Keats himself may serve as a type of the new imaginative
spontaneity and of the new fullness and freshness
of sensuous perception. If Johnson is wise without being
poetical, Keats is poetical without being wise, and here
again we need to remember that distinctions of this kind
are only approximately true. Keats has written lines
that have high seriousness. He has written other lines
which without being wise seem to lay claim to wisdom&mdash;notably
the lines in which, following Shaftesbury and
other æsthetes, he identifies truth and beauty; an identification
that was disproved for practical purposes at
least as far back as the Trojan War. Helen was beautiful,
but was neither good nor true. In general, however,
Keats’s poetry is not sophistical. It is simply delightfully
recreative. There are signs that Keats himself would not
have been content in the long run with a purely recreative
rôle&mdash;to be “the idle singer of an empty day.” Whether
he would ever have achieved genuine ethical purpose is a
question. In working out a wise view of life he did not,
like Dante, have the support of a great and generally
accepted tradition. It is not certain again that he would
ever have developed the critical keenness that enabled
a Sophocles to work out a wise view of life in a less traditional
age than that of Dante. The evidence is rather
that Keats would have succumbed, to his own poetical
detriment, to some of the forms of sham wisdom current
in his day, especially the new humanitarian evangel.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>In any case we may contrast Sophocles and Dante
with Keats as examples of poets who were not merely
poetical but wise&mdash;wise in the relative and imperfect
sense in which it is vouchsafed to mortals to achieve
wisdom. Sophocles and Dante are not perhaps more
poetical than Keats&mdash;it is not easy to be more poetical
than Keats. As Tennyson says, “there is something
magic and of the innermost soul of poetry in almost everything
he wrote.” Yet Sophocles and Dante are not only
superior to Keats, but in virtue of the presence of the
ethical imagination in their work, superior not merely
in degree but in kind. Not that even Sophocles and Dante
maintain themselves uniformly on the level of the ethical
imagination. There are passages in Dante which
are less imaginative than theological. Passages of this
kind are even more numerous in Milton, a poet who on
the whole is highly serious.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> It is in general easy to be
didactic, hard to achieve ethical insight.</p>

<p>If Keats is highly imaginative and poetic without on
the whole rising to high seriousness or sinking to sophistry,
Shelley, on the other hand, illustrates in his imaginative
activity the confusion of values that was so fostered
by romanticism. Here again I do not wish to be too
absolute. Shelley has passages especially in his “Adonais”
that are on a high level. Yet nothing is more certain
than that the quality of his imagination is on the whole
not ethical but Arcadian or pastoral. In the name of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Arcadia conceived as the “ideal” he refuses to face the
facts of life. I have already spoken of the flimsiness of
his “Prometheus Unbound” as a solution of the problem
of evil. What is found in this play is the exact opposite
of imaginative concentration on the human law.
The imagination wanders irresponsibly in a region quite
outside of normal human experience. We are hindered
from enjoying the gorgeous iridescences of Shelley’s
cloudland by Shelley’s own evident conviction that it
is not a cloudland, an “intense inane,” but a true empyrean
of the spirit. And our irritation at Shelley’s own
confusion is further increased by the long train of his
indiscreet admirers. Thus Professor C.H. Herford writes
in the “Cambridge History of English Literature” that
what Shelley has done in the “Prometheus Unbound,”
is to give “magnificent expression to the faith of Plato
and of Christ”!<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Such a statement in such a place is a
veritable danger signal, an indication of some grave
spiritual bewilderment in the present age. To show the
inanity of these attempts to make a wise man of Shelley
it is enough to compare him not with Plato and Christ,
but with the poet whom he set out at once to continue
and contradict&mdash;with Æschylus. The “Prometheus
Bound” has the informing ethical imagination that the
“Prometheus Unbound” lacks, and so in its total structure
belongs to an entirely different order of art. Shelley,
indeed, has admirable details. The romanticism of
nympholeptic longing may almost be said to culminate,
at least in England, in the passage I have already cited
(“My soul is an enchanted boat”). There is no reason
why in recreative moods one should not imagine on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>e’s
soul an enchanted boat and float away in a musical rapture
with the ideal dream companion towards Arcady.
But to suppose that revery of this kind has anything to
do with the faith of Plato and of Christ, is to fall from
illusion into dangerous delusion.</p>

<p>We may doubt whether if Shelley had lived longer he
would ever have risen above emotional sophistry and
become more ethical in the quality of his imagination.
Such a progress from emotional sophistry to ethical insight
we actually find in Goethe; and this is the last and
most complex case we have to consider. Johnson, I have
said, is wise without being poetical and Keats poetical
without being wise; Sophocles is both poetical and wise,
whereas Shelley is poetical, but with a taint of sophistry
or sham wisdom. No such clear-cut generalization can be
ventured about Goethe. I have already quoted Goethe’s
own judgment on his “Werther” as weakness seeking to
give itself the prestige of strength, and perhaps it would
be possible to instance from his early writings even worse
examples of a morbid emotionalism (e.g. “Stella”). How
about “Faust” itself? Most Germans will simply dismiss
such a question as profane. With Hermann Grimm they
are ready to pronounce “Faust” the greatest work of the
greatest poet of all times, and of all peoples. Yet it is not
easy to overlook the sophistical element in both parts of
“Faust.” I have already commented on those passages
that would seem especially sophistical: the passage in
which the devil is defined as the spirit that always says
no strikes at the very root of any proper distinction between
good and evil. The passage again in which Faust
breaks down all precise discrimination in favor of mere
emotional intoxication is an extreme example of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
Rousseauistic art of “making madness beautiful.” The
very conclusion of the whole poem, with its setting up of
work according to the natural law as a substitute for work
according to the human law, is an egregious piece of sham
wisdom. The result of work according to the human law,
of ethical efficiency in short, is an increasing serenity; and
it is not clear that Faust is much calmer at the end of the
poem than he is at the beginning. According to Dr. Santayana
he is ready to carry into heaven itself his romantic
restlessness&mdash;his desperate and feverish attempts to
escape from ennui.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Perhaps this is not the whole truth
even in regard to “Faust”; and still less can we follow
Dr. Santayana when he seems to discover in the whole
work of Goethe only romantic restlessness. At the very
time when Goethe was infecting others with the wild
expansiveness of the new movement, he himself was beginning
to strike out along an entirely different path.
He writes in his Journal as early as 1778: “A more definite
feeling of limitation and in consequence of true broadening.”
Goethe here glimpses the truth that lies at the
base of both humanism and religion. He saw that the
romantic disease was the imaginative and emotional
straining towards the unlimited (<i>Hang zum Unbegrenzten</i>),
and in opposition to this unrestraint he was never
tired of preaching the need of working within boundaries.
It may be objected that Goethe is in somewhat the same
case here as Rousseau: that the side of his work which
has imaginative and emotional driving power and has
therefore moved the world is of an entirely different
order. We may reply that Goethe is at times both poetical
and wise. Furthermore in his maxims and conversations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
where he does not rise to the poetical level, he displays a
higher quality of wisdom than Rousseau. At his best he
shows an ethical realism worthy of Dr. Johnson, though
in his attitude towards tradition he is less Johnsonian
than Socratic. Like Socrates he saw on what terms a
break with the past may be safely attempted. “Anything
that emancipates the spirit,” he says, “without
a corresponding growth in self-mastery, is pernicious.”
We may be sure that if the whole modern experiment
fails it will be because of the neglect of the truth contained
in this maxim. Goethe also saw that a sound individualism
must be rightly imaginative. He has occasional
hints on the rôle of illusion in literature and life
that go far beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Though the mature Goethe, then, always stands for
salvation by work, it is not strictly correct to say that it
is work only according to the natural law. In Goethe at
his best the imagination accepts the limitations imposed
not merely by the natural, but also by the human law.
However, we must admit that the humanistic Goethe
has had few followers either in Germany or elsewhere,
whereas innumerable persons have escaped from the imaginative
unrestraint of the emotional romanticist, as
Goethe himself likewise did, by the discipline of science.</p>

<p>The examples I have chosen should suffice to show how
my distinction between two main types of imagination&mdash;the
ethical type that gives high seriousness to creative
writing and the Arcadian or dalliant type that does not
raise it above the recreative level&mdash;works out in practice.
Some such distinction is necessary if we are to understand
the imagination in its relation to the human law. But
in order to grasp the present situation firmly we need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
also to consider the imagination in its relation to the
natural law. I have just said that most men have escaped
from the imaginative anarchy of the emotional romanticist
through science. Now the man of science at his
best is like the humanist at his best, at once highly imaginative
and highly critical. By this coöperation of
imagination and intellect they are both enabled to concentrate
effectively on the facts, though on facts of a
very different order. The imagination reaches out and
perceives likenesses and analogies whereas the power in
man that separates and discriminates and traces causes
and effects tests in turn these likenesses and analogies as
to their reality: for we can scarcely repeat too often that
though the imagination gives unity it does not give reality.
If we were all Aristotles or even Goethes we might
concentrate imaginatively on both laws, and so be both
scientific and humanistic: but as a matter of fact the
ordinary man’s capacity for concentration is limited.
After a spell of concentration on either law he aspires to
what Aristotle calls “relief from tension.” Now the very
conditions of modern life require an almost tyrannical
concentration on the natural law. The problems that
have been engaging more and more the attention of the
Occident since the rise of the great Baconian movement
have been the problems of power and speed and utility.
The enormous mass of machinery that has been accumulated
in the pursuit of these ends requires the closest
attention and concentration if it is to be worked efficiently.
At the same time the man of the West is not willing
to admit that he is growing in power alone, he likes
to think that he is growing also in wisdom. Only by keeping
this situation in mind can we hope to understand how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
emotional romanticism has been able to develop into a
vast system of sham spirituality. I have said that the
Rousseauist wants unity without reality. If we are to
move towards reality, the imagination must be controlled
by the power of discrimination and the Rousseauist
has repudiated this power as “false and secondary.”
But a unity that lacks reality can scarcely be accounted
wise. The Baconian, however, accepts this unity gladly.
He has spent so much energy in working according to
the natural law that he has no energy left for work according
to the human law. By turning to the Rousseauist
he can get the “relief from tension” that he needs
and at the same time enjoy the illusion of receiving a
vast spiritual illumination. Neither Rousseauist nor
Baconian carry into the realm of the human law the keen
analysis that is necessary to distinguish between genuine
insight and some mere phantasmagoria of the emotions.
I am speaking especially, of course, of the interplay of
Rousseauistic and Baconian elements that appear in
certain recent philosophies like that of Bergson. According
to Bergson one becomes spiritual by throwing overboard
both thought and action, and this is a very convenient
notion of spirituality for those who wish to devote both
thought and action to utilitarian and material ends. It
is hard to see in Bergson’s intuition of the creative flux
and perception of real duration anything more than the
latest form of Rousseau’s transcendental idling. To
work with something approaching frenzy according to the
natural law and to be idle according to the human law
must be accounted a rather one-sided view of life. The
price the man of to-day has paid for his increase in power
is, it should seem, an appalling superficiality in dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
with the law of his own nature. What brings together
Baconian and Rousseauist in spite of their surface differences
is that they are both intent on the element of
novelty. But if wonder is associated with the Many,
wisdom is associated with the One. Wisdom and wonder
are moving not in the same but in opposite directions.
The nineteenth century may very well prove to have
been the most wonderful and the least wise of centuries.
The men of this period&mdash;and I am speaking of course of
the main drift&mdash;were so busy being wonderful that they
had no time, apparently, to be wise. Yet their extreme
absorption in wonder and the manifoldness of things can
scarcely be commended unless it can be shown that happiness
also results from all this revelling in the element of
change. The Rousseauist is not quite consistent on this
point. At times he bids us boldly set our hearts on
the transitory. <i>Aimez</i>, says Vigny, <i>ce que jamais on ne
verra deux fois</i>. But the Rousseauist strikes perhaps a
deeper chord when looking forth on a world of flux he
utters the anguished exclamation of Leconte de Lisle:
<i>Qu’est-ce que tout cela qui n’est pas éternel?</i> Even as
one swallow, says Aristotle, does not make a spring,
so no short time is enough to determine whether a man
deserves to be called happy. The weakness of the romantic
pursuit of novelty and wonder and in general of the
philosophy of the beautiful moment&mdash;whether the
erotic moment<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> or the moment of cosmic revery&mdash;is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
it does not reckon sufficiently with the something deep
down in the human breast that craves the abiding. To pin
one’s hope of happiness to the fact that “the world is so
full of a number of things” is an appropriate sentiment for
a “Child’s Garden of Verse.” For the adult to maintain
an exclusive Bergsonian interest in “the perpetual gushing
forth of novelties” would seem to betray an inability
to mature. The effect on a mature observer of an age so
entirely turned from the One to the Many as that in
which we are living must be that of a prodigious peripheral
richness joined to a great central void.</p>

<p>What leads the man of to-day to work with such energy
according to the natural law and to be idle according
to the human law is his intoxication with material success.
A consideration that should therefore touch him is
that in the long run not merely spiritual success or happiness,
but material prosperity depend on an entirely
different working. Let me revert here for a moment to
my previous analysis: to work according to the human
law is simply to rein in one’s impulses. Now the strongest
of all the impulses is the will to power. The man who does
not rein in his will to power and is at the same time very
active according to the natural law is in a fair way to
become an efficient megalomaniac. Efficient megalomania,
whether developed in individuals of the same
group or in whole national groups in their relations with
one another, must lead sooner or later to war. The efficient
megalomaniacs will proceed to destroy one another
along with the material wealth to which they have sacrificed
everything else; and then the meek, if there are any
meek left, will inherit the earth.</p>

<p>“If I am to judge by myself,” said an eighteenth-century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
Frenchman, “man is a stupid animal.” Man is
not only a stupid animal in spite of his conceit of his own
cleverness but we are here at the source of his stupidity.
The source is the moral indolence that Buddha with his
almost infallible sagacity defined long ago. In spite of the
fact that his spiritual and in the long run his material
success hinge on his ethical effort, man persists in dodging
this effort, in seeking to follow the line of least or lesser
resistance. An energetic material working does not mend
but aggravate the failure to work ethically and is therefore
especially stupid. Just this combination has in fact
led to the crowning stupidity of the ages&mdash;the Great
War. No more delirious spectacle has ever been witnessed
than that of hundreds of millions of human beings
using a vast machinery of scientific efficiency to turn life
into a hell for one another. It is hard to avoid concluding
that we are living in a world that has gone wrong on first
principles, a world that, in spite of all the warnings of the
past, has allowed itself to be caught once more in the
terrible naturalistic trap. The dissolution of civilization
with which we are threatened is likely to be worse in
some respects than that of Greece or Rome in view of the
success that has been attained in “perfecting the mystery
of murder.” Various traditional agencies are indeed
still doing much to chain up the beast in man. Of these
the chief is no doubt the Church. But the leadership of
the Occident is no longer here. The leaders have succumbed
in greater or less degree to naturalism<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> and so
have been tampering with the moral law. That the brutal
imperialist who brooks no obstacle to his lust for dominion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
has been tampering with this law goes without saying;
but the humanitarian, all adrip with brotherhood and
profoundly convinced of the loveliness of his own soul,
has been tampering with it also, and in a more dangerous
way for the very reason that it is less obvious. This tampering
with the moral law, or what amounts to the same
thing, this overriding of the veto power in man, has been
largely a result, though not a necessary result, of the
rupture with the traditional forms of wisdom. The Baconian
naturalist repudiated the past because he wished to
be more positive and critical, to plant himself upon the
facts. Yet the veto power is itself a fact,&mdash;the weightiest
with which man has to reckon. The Rousseauistic
naturalist threw off traditional control because he wished
to be more imaginative. Yet without the veto power the
imagination falls into sheer anarchy. Both Baconian and
Rousseauist were very impatient of any outer authority
that seemed to stand between them and their own perceptions.
Yet the veto power is nothing abstract, nothing
that one needs to take on hearsay, but is very immediate.
The naturalistic leaders may be proved wrong without
going beyond their own principles, and their wrongness is
of a kind to wreck civilization.</p>

<p>I have no quarrel, it is scarcely necessary to add,
either with the man of science or the romanticist when
they keep in their proper place. As soon however as they
try, whether separately or in unison, to set up some substitute
for humanism or religion, they should be at once
attacked, the man of science for not being sufficiently
positive and critical, the romanticist for not being rightly
imaginative.</p>

<p>This brings us back to the problem of the ethical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
imagination&mdash;the imagination that has accepted the veto
power&mdash;which I promised a moment ago to treat in its
larger aspects. This problem is indeed in a peculiar sense
the problem of civilization itself. A curious circumstance
should be noted here: a civilization that rests on dogma
and outer authority cannot afford to face the whole truth
about the imagination and its rôle. A civilization in which
dogma and outer authority have been undermined by the
critical spirit, not only can but must do this very thing
if it is to continue at all. Man, a being ever changing and
living in a world of change, is, as I said at the outset,
cut off from immediate access to anything abiding and
therefore worthy to be called real, and condemned to live
in an element of fiction or illusion. Yet civilization must
rest on the recognition of something abiding. It follows
that the truths on the survival of which civilization depends
cannot be conveyed to man directly but only
through imaginative symbols. It seems hard, however,
for man to analyze critically this disability under which
he labors, and, facing courageously the results of his
analysis, to submit his imagination to the necessary control.
He consents to limit his expansive desires only when
the truths that are symbolically true are presented to him
as literally true. The salutary check upon his imagination
is thus won at the expense of the critical spirit. The pure
gold of faith needs, it should seem, if it is to gain currency,
to be alloyed with credulity. But the civilization that
results from humanistic or religious control tends to
produce the critical spirit. Sooner or later some Voltaire
utters his fatal message:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Les prêtres ne sont pas ce qu’un vain peuple pense;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Nôtre crédulité fait toute leur science.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>The emancipation from credulous belief leads to an
anarchic individualism that tends in turn to destroy
civilization. There is some evidence in the past that it is
not quite necessary to run through this cycle. Buddha,
for example, was very critical; he had a sense of the flux
and evanescence of all things and so of universal illusion
keener by far than that of Anatole France; at the same
time he had ethical standards even sterner than those of
Dr. Johnson. This is a combination that the Occident has
rarely seen and that it perhaps needs to see. At the very
end of his life Buddha uttered words that deserve to be
the Magna Charta of the true individualist: “Therefore,
O Ananda, be ye lamps unto yourselves. Be ye refuges
unto yourselves. Look to no outer refuge. Hold fast as a
refuge unto the Law (<i>Dhamma</i>).”<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> A man may safely go
into himself if what he finds there is not, like Rousseau,
his own emotions, but like Buddha, the law of righteousness.</p>

<p>Men were induced to follow Rousseau in his surrender
to the emotions, it will be remembered, because that
seemed the only alternative to a hard and dry rationalism.
The rationalists of the Enlightenment were for the
most part Cartesians, but Kant himself is in his main
trend a rationalist. The epithet critical usually applied to
his philosophy is therefore a misnomer. For to solve the
critical problem&mdash;the relation between appearance and
reality&mdash;it is necessary to deal adequately with the rôle
of the imagination and this Kant has quite failed to do.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Modern philosophy is in general so unsatisfactory because
it has raised the critical problem without carrying it
through; it is too critical to receive wisdom through the
traditional channels and not critical enough to achieve
insight, and so has been losing more and more its human
relevancy, becoming in the words of one of its recent
votaries, a “narrow and unfruitful eccentricity.” The
professional philosophers need to mend their ways and
that speedily if the great world is not to pass them disdainfully
by and leave them to play their mysterious
little game among themselves. We see one of the most
recent groups, the new realists, flat on their faces before
the man of science&mdash;surely an undignified attitude for a
philosopher. It is possible to look on the kind of knowledge
that science gives as alone real only by dodging the
critical problem&mdash;the problem as to the trustworthiness
of the human instrument through which all knowledge is
received&mdash;and it would be easy to show, if this were the
place to go into the more technical aspects of the question,
that the new realists have been doing just this&mdash;whether
through sheer naïveté or metaphysical despair I
am unable to say. The truly critical observer is unable
to discover anything real in the absolute sense since
everything is mixed with illusion. In this absolute sense
the man of science must ever be ignorant of the reality
behind the shows of nature. The new realist is, however,
justified relatively in thinking that the only thing real in
the view of life that has prevailed of late has been its
working according to the natural law and the fruits of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
working. The self-deception begins when he assumes that
there can be no other working. What I have myself been
opposing to naturalistic excess, such as appears in the
new realism, is insight; but insight is in itself only a
word, and unless it can be shown to have its own working
and its own fruits, entirely different from those of work
according to the natural law, the positivist at all events
will have none of it.</p>

<p>The positivist will not only insist upon fruits, but will
rate these fruits themselves according to their bearing
upon his main purpose. Life, says Bergson, can have no
purpose in the human sense of the word.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> The positivist
will reply to Bergson and to the Rousseauistic drifter in
general, in the words of Aristotle, that the end is the chief
thing of all and that the end of ends is happiness. To the
Baconian who wants work and purpose but according to
the natural law alone, the complete positivist will reply
that happiness cannot be shown to result from this one-sided
working; that in itself it affords no escape from the
misery of moral solitude, that we move towards true
communion and so towards peace and happiness only
by work according to the human law. Now the more individualistic
we are, I have been saying, the more we must
depend for the apprehension of this law on the imagination,
the imagination, let me hasten to add, supplemented
by the intellect. It is not enough to put the brakes on the
natural man&mdash;and that is what work according to the
human law means&mdash;we must do it intelligently. Right
knowing must here as elsewhere precede right doing.
Even a Buddha admitted that at one period in his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
he had not been intelligent in his self-discipline. I need
only to amplify here what I have said in a previous chapter
about the proper use of the “false secondary power”
by those who wish to be either religious or humanistic
in a positive fashion. They will employ their analytical
faculties, not in building up some abstract system,
but in discriminating between the actual data of
experience with a view to happiness, just as the man of
science at his best employs the same faculties in discriminating
between the data of experience with a view to
power and utility.</p>

<p>I have pointed out another important use of the analytical
intellect in its relation to the imagination. Since the
imagination by itself gives unity but does not give reality,
it is possible to discover whether a unification of life
has reality only by subjecting it to the keenest analysis.
Otherwise what we take to be wisdom may turn out to be
only an empty dream. To take as wise something that is
unreal is to fall into sophistry. For a man like Rousseau
whose imagination was in its ultimate quality not ethical
at all but overwhelmingly idyllic to set up as an inspired
teacher was to become an arch-sophist. Whether or not
he was sincere in his sophistry is a question which the
emotionalist is very fond of discussing, but which the
sensible person will dismiss as somewhat secondary.
Sophistry of all kinds always has a powerful ally in man’s
moral indolence. It is so pleasant to let one’s self go and
at the same time deem one’s self on the way to wisdom.
We need to keep in mind the special quality of Rousseau’s
sophistry if we wish to understand a very extraordinary
circumstance during the past century. During
this period men were moving steadily towards the naturalistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
level, where the law of cunning and the law of force
prevail, and at the same time had the illusion&mdash;or at
least multitudes had the illusion&mdash;that they were moving
towards peace and brotherhood. The explanation
is found in the endless tricks played upon the uncritical
and still more upon the half-critical by the Arcadian
imagination.</p>

<p>The remedy is not only a more stringent criticism, but,
as I have tried to make plain in this whole work, in an
age of sophistry, like the present, criticism itself amounts
largely to that art of inductive defining which it is the
great merit of Socrates, according to Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> to have
devised and brought to perfection. Sophistry flourishes,
as Socrates saw, on the confused and ambiguous use of
general terms; and there is an inexhaustible source of
such ambiguities and confusions in the very duality of
human nature. The word nature itself may serve as an
illustration. We may take as a closely allied example the
word progress. Man may progress according to either the
human or the natural law. Progress according to the natural
law has been so rapid since the rise of the Baconian
movement that it has quite captivated man’s imagination
and stimulated him to still further concentration and
effort along naturalistic lines. The very magic of the word
progress seems to blind him to the failure to progress
according to the human law. The more a word refers to
what is above the strictly material level, the more it
is subject to the imagination and therefore to sophistication.
It is not easy to sophisticate the word horse, it is
only too easy to sophisticate the word justice. One may
affirm, indeed, not only that man is governed by his imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
but that in all that belongs to his own special
domain <i>the imagination itself is governed by words</i>.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>We should not therefore surrender our imaginations
to a general term until it has been carefully defined, and
to define it carefully we need usually to practice upon it
what Socrates would call a dichotomy. I have just been
dichotomizing or “cutting in two” the word progress.
When the two main types of progress, material and
moral, have been discriminated in their fruits, the positivist
will proceed to rate these fruits according to their
relevancy to his main goal&mdash;the goal of happiness. The
person who is thus fortified by a Socratic dialectic will be
less ready to surrender his imagination to the first sophist
who urges him to be “progressive.” He will wish to make
sure first that he is not progressing towards the edge of a
precipice.</p>

<p>Rousseau would have us get rid of analysis in favor of
the “heart.” No small part of my endeavor in this work
and elsewhere has been to show the different meanings
that may attach to the term heart (and the closely allied
terms “soul” and “intuition”)&mdash;meanings that are a
world apart, when tested by their fruits. Heart may refer
to outer perception and the emotional self or to inner
perception and the ethical self. The heart of Pascal is not
the heart of Rousseau. With this distinction once obliterated
the way is open for the Rousseauistic corruption of
such words as virtue and conscience, and this is to fling
wide the door to every manner of confusion. The whole
vocabulary that is properly applicable only to the supersensuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
realm is then transferred to the region of the
subrational. The impulsive self proceeds to cover its
nakedness with all these fair phrases as it would with
a garment. A recent student of war-time psychology asks:
“Is it that the natural man in us has been masquerading
as the spiritual man by hiding himself under splendid
words&mdash;courage, patriotism, justice&mdash;and now he rises
up and glares at us with blood-red eyes?” That is precisely
what has been happening.</p>

<p>But after all the heart in any sense of the word is controlled
by the imagination, so that a still more fundamental
dichotomy, perhaps the most fundamental of all, is
that of the imagination itself. We have seen how often
the Arcadian dreaming of the emotional naturalist has
been labelled the “ideal.” Our views of this type of imagination
will therefore determine our views of much that
now passes current as idealism. Now the term idealist
may have a sound meaning: it may designate the man
who is realistic according to the human law. But to be an
idealist in Shelley’s sense or that of innumerable other
Rousseauists is to fall into sheer unreality. This type of
idealist shrinks from the sharp discriminations of the
critic: they are like the descent of a douche of ice-water
upon his hot illusions. But it is pleasanter, after all, to be
awakened by a douche of ice-water than by an explosion
of dynamite under the bed; and that has been the frequent
fate of the romantic idealist. It is scarcely safe to
neglect any important aspect of reality in favor of one’s
private dream, even if this dream be dubbed the ideal.
The aspect of reality that one is seeking to exclude finally
comes crashing through the walls of the ivory tower and
abolishes the dream and at times the dreamer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>The transformation of the Arcadian dreamer into the
Utopist is a veritable menace to civilization. The ends
that the Utopist proposes are often in themselves desirable
and the evils that he denounces are real. But when we
come to scrutinize critically his means, what we find is not
a firm grip on the ascertained facts of human nature but
what Bagehot calls the feeble idealities of the romantic
imagination. Moreover various Utopists may come together
as to what they wish to destroy, which is likely to
include the whole existing social order; but what they
wish to erect on the ruins of this order will be found to
be not only in dreamland, but in different dreamlands.
For with the elimination of the veto power from personality&mdash;the
only power that can pull men back to some
common centre&mdash;the ideal will amount to little more
than the projection of this or that man’s temperament
upon the void. In a purely temperamental world an
affirmative reply may be given to the question of Euryalus
in Virgil: “Is each man’s God but his own fell desire?”
(<i>An sua cuique deus fit dira cupido?</i>)</p>

<p>The task of the Socratic critic at the present time is,
then, seen to consist largely in stripping idealistic disguises
from egoism, in exposing what I have called sham
spirituality. If the word spirituality means anything, it
must imply, it should seem, some degree of escape from
the ordinary self, an escape that calls in turn for effort
according to the human law. Even when he is not an open
and avowed advocate of a “wise passiveness,” the Rousseauistic
idealist is only too manifestly not making any
such effort&mdash;it would interfere with his passion for self-expression
which is even more deeply rooted in him than
his passion for saving society. He inclines like Rousseau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
to look upon every constraint<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> whether from within or
from without as incompatible with liberty. A right definition
of liberty is almost as important as a right definition
of imagination and derives from it very directly. Where
in our anarchical age will such a definition be found, a
definition that is at once modern and in accord with the
psychological facts? “A man has only to declare himself
free,” says Goethe, “and he will at once feel himself
dependent. If he ventures to declare himself dependent,
he will feel himself free.” In other words he is not free to do
whatever he pleases unless he wishes to enjoy the freedom
of the lunatic, but only to adjust himself to the
reality of either the natural or the human law. A progressive
adjustment to the human law gives ethical efficiency,
and this is the proper corrective of material efficiency,
and not love alone as the sentimentalist is so fond
of preaching. Love is another word that cries aloud for
Socratic treatment.</p>

<p>A liberty that means only emancipation from outer
control will result, I have tried to show, in the most
dangerous form of anarchy&mdash;anarchy of the imagination.
On the degree of our perception of this fact will
hinge the soundness of our use of another general term&mdash;democracy.
We should beware above all of surrendering
our imaginations to this word until it has been hedged
about on every side with discriminations that have behind
them all the experience of the past with this form of
government. Only in this way may the democrat know
whether he is aiming at anything real or merely dreaming
of the golden age. Here as elsewhere there are pitfalls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
manifold for the uncritical enthusiast. A democracy that
produces in sufficient numbers sound individualists who
look up imaginatively to standards set above their ordinary
selves, may well deserve enthusiasm. A democracy,
on the other hand, that is not rightly imaginative, but is
impelled by vague emotional intoxications, may mean all
kinds of lovely things in dreamland, but in the real world
it will prove an especially unpleasant way of returning
to barbarism. It is a bad sign that Rousseau, who is more
than any other one person the father of radical democracy,
is also the first of the great anti-intellectualists.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show the proper rôle of the
secondary power of analysis that the Rousseauist looks
upon with so much disfavor. It is the necessary auxiliary
of the art of defining that can alone save us in an untraditional
age from receiving some mere phantasmagoria
of the intellect or emotions as a radiant idealism. A Socratic
dialectic of this kind is needed at such a time not
only to dissipate sophistry but as a positive support to
wisdom. I have raised the question in my Introduction
whether the wisdom that is needed just now should be
primarily humanistic or religious. The preference I have
expressed for a positive and critical humanism I wish to
be regarded as very tentative. In the dark situation that
is growing up in the Occident, all genuine humanism and
religion, whether on a traditional or a critical basis,
should be welcome. I have pointed out that traditional
humanism and religion conflict in certain respects, that
it is difficult to combine the imitation of Horace with the
imitation of Christ. This problem does not disappear entirely
when humanism and religion are dealt with critically
and is indeed one of the most obscure that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
thinker has to face. The honest thinker, whatever his own
preference, must begin by admitting that though religion
can get along without humanism, humanism cannot get
along without religion. The reason has been given by
Burke in pointing out the radical defect of Rousseau:
the whole ethical life of man has its root in humility. As
humility diminishes, conceit or vain imagining rushes in
almost automatically to take its place. Under these circumstances
decorum, the supreme virtue of the humanist,
is in danger of degenerating into some art of going
through the motions. Such was only too often the decorum
of the French drawing-room, and such we are told,
has frequently been the decorum of the Chinese humanist.
Yet the decorum of Confucius himself was not only genuine
but he has put the case for the humanist with his
usual shrewdness. “I venture to ask about death,” one of
his disciples said to him. “While you do not know life,”
Confucius replied, “how can you know about death?”<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The solution of this problem as to the relation between
humanism and religion, so far as a solution can be found,
lies in looking upon them both as only different stages
in the same path. Humanism should have in it an element
of religious insight: it is possible to be a humble and
meditative humanist. The type of the man of the world
who is not a mere worldling is not only attractive in itself
but has actually been achieved in the West, though not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
perhaps very often, from the Greeks down. Chinese who
should be in a position to know affirm again that, alongside
many corrupt mandarins, a certain number of true
Confucians<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> have been scattered through the centuries
from the time of the sage to the present.</p>

<p>If humanism may be religious, religion may have its
humanistic side. I have said, following Aristotle, that the
law of measure does not apply to the religious life, but
this saying is not to be understood in an absolute sense.
Buddha is continually insisting on the middle path in the
religious life itself. The resulting urbanity in Buddha and
his early followers in India is perhaps the closest approach
that that very unhumanistic land has ever made
to humanism.</p>

<p>It is right here in this joining of humanism and religion
that Aristotle, at least the Aristotle that has come
down to us, does not seem altogether adequate. He fails
to bring out sufficiently the bond between the meditative
or religious life that he describes at the end of his “Ethics”
and the humanistic life or life of mediation to which
most of this work is devoted. An eminent French authority
on Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> complains that this separation of the
two lives encouraged the ascetic excess of the Middle
Ages, the undue spurning of the world in favor of mystic
contemplation. I am struck rather by the danger of leaving
the humanistic life without any support in religion.
In a celebrated passage,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Aristotle says that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
“magnanimous” man or ideal gentleman sees all things including
himself proportionately: he puts himself neither
too high nor too low. And this is no doubt true so far as
other men are concerned. But does the magnanimous
man put human nature itself in its proper place? Does
he feel sufficiently its nothingness and helplessness, its
dependence on a higher power? No one, indeed, who gets
beyond words and outer forms would maintain that humility
is a Christian monopoly. Pindar is far more humble<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
than Aristotle, as humble, one might almost maintain,
as the austere Christian.</p>

<p>A humanism sufficiently grounded in humility is not
only desirable at all times but there are reasons for thinking
that it would be especially desirable to-day. In the
first place, it would so far as the emotional naturalist is
concerned raise a clear-cut issue. The naturalist of this
type denies rather than corrupts humanism. He is the
foe of compromise and inclines to identify mediation
and mediocrity. On the other hand, he corrupts rather
than denies religion, turning meditation into pantheistic
revery and in general setting up a subtle parody of what
is above the ordinary rational level in terms of the subrational.
On their own showing Rousseau and his followers
are extremists,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and even more effective perhaps than
to attack them directly for their sham religion would be
to maintain against them that thus to violate the law
of measure is to cease to be human.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a critical humanism would appear to be
the proper corrective of the other main forms of naturalistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
excess at the present time&mdash;the one-sided devotion
to physical science. What keeps the man of science from
being himself a humanist is not his science but his pseudo-science,
and also the secret push for power and prestige
that he shares with other men. The reasons for putting
humanistic truth above scientific truth are not metaphysical
but very practical: the discipline that helps a man
to self-mastery is found to have a more important bearing
on his happiness than the discipline that helps him to a
mastery of physical nature. If scientific discipline is not
supplemented by a truly humanistic or religious discipline
the result is unethical science, and unethical science
is perhaps the worst monster that has yet been turned
loose on the race. Man in spite of what I have termed his
stupidity, his persistent evasion of the main issue, the
issue of his own happiness, will awaken sooner or later
to the fearful evil he has already suffered from a science
that has arrogated to itself what does not properly belong
to it; and then science may be as unduly depreciated as it
has, for the past century or two, been unduly magnified;
so that in the long run it is in the interest of science itself
to keep in its proper place, which is below both humanism
and religion.</p>

<p>It would be possible to frame in the name of insight an
indictment against science that would make the indictment
Rousseau has framed against it in the name of
instinct seem mild. The critical humanist, however, will
leave it to others to frame such an indictment. Nothing
is more foreign to his nature than every form of obscurantism.
He is ready indeed to point out that the man of
science has in common with him at least one important
idea&mdash;the idea of habit, though its scientific form seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
to him very incomplete. One may illustrate from perhaps
the best known recent treatment of the subject, that of
James in his “Psychology.” It is equally significant that
the humanist can agree with nearly every line of James’s
chapter on habit and that he disagrees very gravely with
James in his total tendency. That is because James shows
himself, as soon as he passes from the naturalistic to the
humanistic level, wildly romantic. Even when dealing
with the “Varieties of Religious Experience” he is plainly
more preoccupied with the intensity than with the centrality
of this experience.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> He is obsessed with the idea
that comes down to him straight from the age of original
genius that to be at the centre is to be commonplace. In
a letter to C. E. Norton (June 30, 1904) James praises
Ruskin’s Letters and adds: “Mere sanity is the most
philistine and at bottom unessential of a man’s attributes.”
“Mere sanity” is not to be thus dismissed, because
to lack sanity is to be headed towards misery and
even madness. “Ruskin’s,” says Norton, who was in a
position to know, “was essentially one of the saddest of
lives.”<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Is a man to live one of the saddest of lives merely
to gratify romantic lovers of the vivid and picturesque
like James?</p>

<p>However, if the man of science holds fast to the results
reached by James and others regarding habit and at the
same time avoids James’s romantic fallacies he might perceive
the possibility of extending the idea of habit beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the naturalistic level; and the way would then be
open for an important coöperation between him and the
humanist. Humanists themselves, it must be admitted,
even critical humanists, have diverged somewhat in
their attitude towards habit, and that from the time of
Socrates and Aristotle. I have been dwelling thus far on
the indispensableness of a keen Socratic dialectic and of
the right knowledge it brings for those who aspire to be
critical humanists. But does right knowing in itself suffice
to ensure right doing? Socrates and Plato with their
famous identification of knowledge and virtue would seem
to reply in the affirmative. Aristotle has the immediate
testimony of consciousness on his side when he remarks
simply regarding this identification: The facts are otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
No experience is sadder or more universal than that
of the failure of right knowledge to secure right performance:
so much so that the austere Christian has been
able to maintain with some plausibility that all the
knowledge in the world is of no avail without a special
divine succor. Now the Aristotelian agrees with the Christian
that mere knowledge is insufficient: conversion is
also necessary. He does not incline, however, like the
austere Christian to look for conversion to “thunderclaps
and visible upsets of grace.” Without denying necessarily
these pistol-shot transformations of human nature he
conceives of man’s turning away from his ordinary self&mdash;and
here he is much nearer in temper to the man of
science&mdash;as a gradual process. This gradual conversion
the Aristotelian hopes to achieve by work according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
the human law. Now right knowledge though it supplies
the norm, is not in itself this working, which consists in
the actual pulling back of impulse. But an act of this kind
to be effective must be repeated. A habit is thus formed
until at last the new direction given to the natural man
becomes automatic and unconscious. The humanistic
worker may thus acquire at last the spontaneity in right
doing that the beautiful soul professes to have received
as a free gift from “nature.” Confucius narrates the
various stages of knowledge and moral effort through
which he had passed from the age of fifteen and concludes:
“At seventy I could follow what my heart desired
without transgressing the law of measure.”<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>The keener the observer the more likely he is to be
struck by the empire of habit. Habit, as Wellington said,
is ten times nature, and is indeed so obviously a second
nature that many of the wise have suspected that nature
herself is only a first habit.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Now Aristotle who is open
to criticism, it may be, on the side of humility, still remains
incomparable among the philosophers of the world
for his treatment of habit on the humanistic level. Any
one who wishes to learn how to become moderate and
sensible and decent can do no better even at this late day
than to steep himself in the “Nicomachean Ethics.”</p>

<p>One of the ultimate contrasts that presents itself in a
subject of this kind is that between habit as conceived by
Aristotle and nature as conceived by Rousseau. The
first great grievance of the critical humanist against
Rousseau is that he set out to be an individualist and at
the same time attacked analysis, which is indispensable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
if one is to be a sound individualist. The second great
grievance of the humanist is that Rousseau sought to discredit
habit which is necessary if right analysis is to be
made effective. “The only habit the child should be
allowed to form,” says Rousseau, “is that of forming no
habit.”<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> How else is the child to follow his bent or
genius and so arrive at full self-expression? The point
I am bringing up is of the utmost gravity, for Rousseau
is by common consent the father of modern education.
To eliminate from education the idea of a progressive
adjustment to a human law, quite apart from temperament,
may be to imperil civilization itself. For civilization
(another word that is sadly in need of Socratic defining)
may be found to consist above all in an orderly
transmission of right habits; and the chief agency for
securing such a transmission must always be education,
by which I mean far more of course than mere formal
schooling.</p>

<p>Rousseau’s repudiation of habit is first of all, it should
be pointed out, perfectly chimerical. The trait of the
child to which the sensible educator will give chief attention
is not his spontaneity, but his proneness to imitate.
In the absence of good models the child will imitate bad
ones, and so, long before the age of intelligent choice and
self-determination, become the prisoner of bad habits.
Men, therefore, who aim at being civilized must come
together, work out a convention in short, regarding the
habits they wish transmitted to the young. A great civilization
is in a sense only a great convention. A sane individualist
does not wish to escape from convention in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
itself; he merely remembers that no convention is final&mdash;that
it is always possible to improve the quality of the
convention in the midst of which he is living, and that it
should therefore be held flexibly. He would oppose no
obstacles to those who are rising above the conventional
level, but would resist firmly those who are sinking beneath
it. It is much easier to determine practically
whether one has to do with an ascent or a descent (even
though the descent be rapturous like that of the Rousseauist)
than our anarchical individualists are willing
to acknowledge.</p>

<p>The notion that in spite of the enormous mass of experience
that has been accumulated in both East and West
we are still without light as to the habits that make for
moderation and good sense and decency, and that education
is therefore still purely a matter of exploration
and experiment is one that may be left to those who are
suffering from an advanced stage of naturalistic intoxication&mdash;for
example, to Professor John Dewey and his
followers. From an ethical point of view a child has the
right to be born into a cosmos, and not, as is coming to
be more and more the case under such influences, pitch-forked
into chaos. But the educational radical, it may be
replied, does stress the idea of habit; and it is true that he
would have the young acquire the habits that make for
material efficiency. This, however, does not go beyond
Rousseau who came out very strongly for what we should
call nowadays vocational training.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> It is the adjustment
to the human law against which Rousseau and all the
Rousseauists are recalcitrant.</p>

<p>Self-expression and vocational training combined in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
various proportions and tempered by the spirit of “service,”
are nearly the whole of the new education. But
I have already said that it is not possible to extract from
any such compounding of utilitarian and romantic elements,
with the resulting material efficiency and ethical
inefficiency, a civilized view of life. It is right here indeed
in the educational field that concerted opposition
to the naturalistic conspiracy against civilization is most
likely to be fruitful. If the present generation&mdash;and I
have in mind especially American conditions&mdash;cannot
come to a working agreement about the ethical training
it wishes given the young, if it allows the drift towards
anarchy on the human level to continue, it will show
itself, however ecstatic it may be over its own progressiveness
and idealism, both cowardly and degenerate.
It is very stupid, assuming that it is not very hypocritical,
to denounce <i>Kultur</i>, and then to adopt educational
ideas that work out in much the same fashion as <i>Kultur</i>,
and have indeed the same historical derivation.</p>

<p>The dehumanizing influences I have been tracing are
especially to be deprecated in higher education. The design
of higher education, so far as it deserves the name,
is to produce leaders, and on the quality of the leadership
must depend more than on any other single factor the
success or failure of democracy. I have already quoted
Aristotle’s saying that “most men would rather live in a
disorderly than in a sober manner.” This does not mean
much more than that most men would like to live temperamentally,
to follow each his own bent and then put
the best face on the matter possible. Most men, says
Goethe in a similar vein, prefer error to truth because
truth imposes limitations and error does not. It is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
also to recall Aristotle’s saying that “the multitude is
incapable of making distinctions.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Now my whole
argument is that to be sound individualists we must not
only make the right distinctions but submit to them until
they become habitual. Does it follow that the whole experiment
in which we are engaged is foredoomed to failure?
Not quite&mdash;though the obstacles to success are somewhat
greater than our democratic enthusiasts suspect.
The most disreputable aspect of human nature, I have
said, is its proneness to look for scapegoats; and my chief
objection to the movement I have been studying is that
more perhaps than any other in history it has encouraged
the evasion of moral responsibility and the setting up of
scapegoats. But as an offset to this disreputable aspect of
man, one may note a creditable trait: he is very sensitive
to the force of a right example. If the leaders of a community
look up to a sound model and work humanistically
with reference to it, all the evidence goes to show
that they will be looked up to and imitated in turn by
enough of the rank and file to keep that community
from lapsing into barbarism. Societies always decay from
the top. It is therefore not enough, as the humanitarian
would have us believe, that our leaders should act vigorously
on the outer world and at the same time be filled
with the spirit of “service.” Purely expansive leaders of
this kind we have seen who have the word humanity
always on their lips and are at the same time ceasing to
be human. “That wherein the superior man cannot
be equalled,” says Confucius, “is simply this&mdash;his work
which other men cannot see.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> It is this inner work and
the habits that result from it that above all humanize a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
man and make him exemplary to the multitude. To perform
this work he needs to look to a centre and a model.</p>

<p>We are brought back here to the final gap that opens
between classicist and romanticist. To look to a centre
according to the romanticist is at the best to display
“reason,” at the worst to be smug and philistine. To look
to a true centre is, on the contrary, according to the
classicist, to grasp the abiding human element through
all the change in which it is implicated, and this calls for
the highest use of the imagination. The abiding human
element exists, even though it cannot be exhausted by
dogmas and creeds, is not subject to rules and refuses to
be locked up in formulæ. A knowledge of it results from
experience,&mdash;experience vivified by the imagination. To
do justice to writing which has this note of centrality
we ourselves need to be in some measure experienced and
imaginative. Writing that is romantic, writing in which
the imagination is not disciplined to a true centre is best
enjoyed while we are young. The person who is as much
taken by Shelley at forty as he was at twenty has, one
may surmise, failed to grow up. Shelley himself wrote to
John Gisborne (October 22, 1821): “As to real flesh and
blood, you know that I do not deal in those articles; you
might as well go to a ginshop for a leg of mutton as expect
anything human or earthly from me.” The mature
man is likely to be dissatisfied with poetry so unsubstantial
as this even as an intoxicant and still more when it is
offered to him as the “ideal.” The very mark of genuinely
classical work, on the other hand, is that it yields its full
meaning only to the mature. Young and old are, as
Cardinal Newman says, affected very differently by the
words of some classic author, such as Homer or Horace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
“Passages, which to a boy are but rhetorical commonplaces,
neither better nor worse than a hundred others
which any clever writer might supply … at length come
home to him, when long years have passed, and he has
had experience of life, and pierce him, as if he had never
before known them, with their sad earnestness and vivid
exactness. Then he comes to understand how it is that
lines, the birth of some chance morning or evening at an
Ionian festival or among the Sabine hills, have lasted generation
after generation for thousands of years, with a
power over the mind and a charm which the current literature
of his own day, with all its obvious advantages, is
utterly unable to rival.”</p>

<p>In the poets whom Newman praises the imagination
is, as it were, centripetal. The neo-classic proneness to
oppose good sense to imagination, and the romantic
proneness to oppose imagination to good sense, have at
least this justification, that in many persons, perhaps in
most persons, the two actually conflict, but surely the
point to emphasize is that they may come together, that
good sense may be imaginative and imagination sensible.
If imagination is not sensible, as is plainly the case in
Victor Hugo, for example, we may suspect a lack of the
universal and ethical quality. All men, even great poets,
are more or less immersed in their personal conceit and
in the zones of illusion peculiar to their age. But there is
the question of degree. The poets to whom the world has
finally accorded its suffrage have not been megalomaniacs;
they have not threatened like Hugo to outbellow the
thunder or pull comets around by the tail.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Bossuet’s
saying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span> “good sense is the master of human life”
does not contradict but complete Pascal’s saying that
“the imagination disposes of everything,” provided only
due stress be laid on the word human. It would not be
easy to live a more imaginative life than Hugo, but his
imagination was so unrestrained that we may ask whether
he lived a very human life, whether he was not rather,
in Tennyson’s phrase, a “weird Titan.” Man realizes
that immensity of his being of which Joubert speaks only
in so far as he ceases to be the thrall of his own ego. This
human breadth he achieves not by throwing off but by
taking on limitations, and what he limits is above all his
imagination. The reason why he should strive for a life
that is thus increasingly full and complete is simply, as
Joubert suggests, that it is more delectable, that it is
found practically to make for happiness.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX<br />
<span class="smaller">CHINESE PRIMITIVISM</span></h2>

<p>Perhaps the closest approach in the past to the movement of
which Rousseau is the most important single figure is the
early Taoist movement in China. Taoism, especially in its popular
aspects, became later something very different, and what
I say is meant to apply above all to the period from about
550 to 200 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> The material for the Taoism of this period will
be found in convenient form in the volume of Léon Wieger
(1913)&mdash;<i>Les Pères du Système taoïste</i> (Chinese texts with
French translations of Lao-tzŭ, Lieh-tzŭ and Chuang-tzŭ).
The Tao Tê King of Lao-tzŭ is a somewhat enigmatical document
of only a few thousand words, but plainly primitivistic in
its general trend. The phrase that best sums up its general
spirit is that of Wordsworth&mdash;a “wise passiveness.” The unity
at which it aims is clearly of the pantheistic variety, the unity
that is obtained by breaking down discrimination and affirming
the “identity of contradictories,” and that encourages a reversion
to origins, to the state of nature and the simple life. According
to the Taoist the Chinese fell from the simple life into
artificiality about the time of the legendary Yellow Emperor,
Hoang-ti (27th century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). The individual also should look
back to beginnings and seek to be once more like the new-born
child<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> or, according to Chuang-tzŭ, like the new-born calf.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> It
is in Chuang-tzŭ indeed that the doctrine develops its full naturalistic
and primitivistic implications. Few writers in either
East or West have set forth more entertainingly what one may
term the Bohemian attitude towards life. He heaps ridicule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
upon Confucius and in the name of spontaneity attacks his
doctrine of humanistic imitation.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> He sings the praises of
the unconscious,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> even when obtained through intoxication,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
and extols the morality of the beautiful soul.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> He traces
the fall of mankind from nature into artifice in a fashion that
anticipates very completely both Rousseau’s Discourse on the
Arts and Sciences<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and that on the Origin of Inequality.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> See
also the amusing passage in which the brigand Chi, child of
nature and champion of the weak against the oppressions of
government, paints a highly Rousseauistic picture of man’s
fall from his primitive felicity.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Among the things that are
contrary to nature and purely conventional, according to
Chuang-tzŭ and the Taoists, are, not only the sciences and arts
and attempts to discriminate between good and bad taste,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> but
likewise government and statecraft,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> virtue and moral standards.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
To the artificial music of the Confucians, the Taoists oppose
a natural music that offers startling analogies to the most
recent programmatic and descriptive tendencies of Occidental
music.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> See especially Chuang-tzŭ’s programme for a cosmic
symphony in three movements<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>&mdash;the <i>Pipes of Pan</i> as one is
tempted to call it. This music that is supposed to reflect in all
its mystery and magic the infinite creative processes of nature
is very close to the primitivistic music (“L’arbre vu du côté
des racines”) with which Hugo’s satyr strikes panic into the
breasts of the Olympians.</p>

<p>The Taoist notion of following nature is closely related, as in
other naturalistic movements, to the idea of fate whether in its
stoical or epicurean form.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> From the references in Chuang-tzŭ<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
and elsewhere to various sects and schools we see that Taoism
was only a part of a great stream of naturalistic and primitivistic
tendency. China abounded at that time in pacifists,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> in
apostles of brotherly love, and as we should say nowadays
Tolstoyans. A true opposite to the egoistic Yang-chu was the
preacher of pure altruism and indiscriminate sympathy, Mei-ti.
Mencius said that if the ideas of either of these extremists prevailed
the time would come, not only when wolves would devour
men, but men would devour one another.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> In opposing
discrimination and ethical standards to the naturalists, Mencius
and the Confucian humanists were fighting for civilization.
Unfortunately there is some truth in the Taoist charge that the
standards of the Confucians are too literal, that in their defence
of the principle of imitation they did not allow sufficiently
for the element of flux and relativity and illusion in things&mdash;an
element for which the Taoists had so keen a sense that they
even went to the point of suppressing the difference between
sleeping and waking<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> and life and death.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> To reply properly
to the Taoist relativist the Confucians would have needed to
work out a sound conception of the rôle of the imagination&mdash;the
universal key to human nature&mdash;and this they do not
seem to have done. One is inclined to ask whether this is the reason
for China’s failure to achieve a great ethical art like that
of the drama and the epic of the Occident at their best. The
Taoists were richly imaginative but along romantic lines. We
should not fail to note the Taoist influence upon Li Po and other
Bohemian and bibulous poets of the Tang dynasty, or the relation
of Taoism to the rise of a great school of landscape painting
at about the same time. We should note also the Taoist element
in “Ch’an” Buddhism (the “Zen” Buddhism<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> of Japan),
some knowledge of which is needed for an understanding of
whole periods of Japanese and Chinese art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>In these later stages, however, the issues are less clear-cut
than in the original struggle between Taoists and Confucians.
The total impression one has of early Taoism is that it is a main
manifestation of an age of somewhat sophistical individualism.
Ancient Chinese individualism ended like that of Greece at
about the same time in disaster. After a period of terrible convulsions
(the era of the “Fighting States”), the inevitable man
on horseback appeared from the most barbaric of these states
and “put the lid” on everybody. Shi Hwang-ti, the new emperor,
had many of the scholars put to death and issued an
edict that the writings of the past, especially the Confucian
writings, should be destroyed (213 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>). Though the emperor
behaved like a man who took literally the Taoist views as to
the blessings of ignorance, it is not clear from our chief authority,
the historian Ssŭ-ma Ch’ien, that he acted entirely or
indeed mainly under Taoist influence.</p>

<p>It is proper to add that though Lao-tzŭ proclaims that the
soft is superior to the hard, a doctrine that should appeal to
the Occidental sentimentalist, one does not find in him or in the
other Taoists the equivalent of the extreme emotional expansiveness
of the Rousseauist. There are passages, especially in
Lao-tzŭ, that in their emphasis on concentration and calm are
in line with the ordinary wisdom of the East; and even where
the doctrine is unmistakably primitivistic the emotional quality
is often different from that of the corresponding movement in
the West.</p>

<h2><a name="BIBLIOGRAPHY" id="BIBLIOGRAPHY"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>My only justification for these very unsystematic bibliographical notes is that,
bringing together as they do under one cover material somewhat scattered and
inaccessible to most readers, they may help to add to the number, now unfortunately
very small, of those who have earned the right to have an opinion
about romanticism as an international movement. A list of this kind is a fragment
of a fragment. I have given, for example, only a fraction of the books on
Rousseau and scarcely any of the books, thousands in numbers, which without
being chiefly on Rousseau, contain important passages on him. I may cite almost
at random as instances of this latter class, the comparison between Burke
and Rousseau in the fifth volume of Lecky’s <i>History of the Eighteenth Century</i>;
the stanzas on Rousseau in the third canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>; the passage on
Rousseau in Hazlitt’s essay on the <i>Past and Future</i> (<i>Table Talk</i>).</p>

<p>The only period that I have covered with any attempt at fullness is that from
about 1795 to 1840. Books that seem to me to possess literary distinction or to
deal authoritatively with some aspect of the subject I have marked with a star.
I make no claim, however, to have read all the books I have listed, and my rating
will no doubt often be questioned in the case of those I have read.</p>

<p>I have not as a rule mentioned articles in periodicals. The files of the following
special publications may often be consulted with profit. Those that have
current bibliographies I have marked with a dagger.</p>

and unoriental in his point of view, deals with a problem that
has always been the special preoccupation of the Hindu. A Hindu, however,
would have entitled a similar volume <i>The World as Illusion</i> (māyā).
Aristotle has much to say of fiction in his <i>Poetics</i> but does not even use the
word imagination (φαντασία). In the <i>Psychology</i>, where he discusses the imagination,
he assigns not to it, but to mind or reason the active and creative
rôle (νοῦς ποιητικός). It is especially the notion of the <i>creative</i> imagination
that is recent. The earliest example of the phrase that I have noted
in French is in Rousseau’s description of his erotic reveries at the Hermitage
(<i>Confessions</i>, Livre <span class="smcapuc">IX</span>).</p>

antediluvian, with his long dyed curls and his old-fashioned dress …
with long coats reaching to the ankles, knee-breeches, and long colored
waistcoats. Also, he appeared always with a young lady who adored him,
and who was followed by a man servant carrying a harp. She sat at his
feet and appeared as he did in the costume of 1830, with long flowing
curls called <i>Anglaises</i>. … In society, however, people ran after him
tremendously, and spoilt him in every possible way. He read aloud from
his own works, and, in especially poetic passages, his ‘Alice’ accompanied
him with arpeggios on the harp.”</p>

and emotional naturalism. Take, for example, the educational theory that
has led to the setting up of the elective system. The general human discipline
embodied in the fixed curriculum is to be discarded in order that the
individual may be free to work along the lines of his bent or “genius.”
In a somewhat similar way scientific naturalism encourages the individual
to sacrifice the general human discipline to a specialty.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_109_109" id="Footnote_109_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109_109"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> The phrase imaginative insight is, I believe, true to the spirit of Plato
at his best, but it is certainly not true to his terminology. Plato puts the
imagination (φαντασία) not only below intuitive reason (νοῦς) and discursive
reason or understanding (διάνοια), but even below outer perception
(πίστις). He recognizes indeed that it may reflect the operations of the
understanding and even the higher reason as well as the impressions of
sense. This notion of a superior intellectual imagination was carried much
further by Plotinus and the neo-Platonists. Even the intellectual imagination
is, however, conceived of as passive. Perhaps no Greek thinker, not
even Plato, makes as clear as he might that reason gets its intuition of
reality and the One with the aid of the imagination and, as it were, through
a veil of illusion, that, in Joubert’s phrase, “l’illusion est une partie inté,
grante de la réalité” (<i>Pensées</i>, Titre <span class="smcapuc">XI</span>, <span class="smcapuc">XXXIX</span>). Joubert again distinguishes
(<i>ibid.</i>, Titre <span class="smcapuc">III</span>, <span class="smcapuc">XLVII</span>, <span class="smcapuc">LI</span>) between “l’imaginative” which is passive
and “l’imagination” which is active and creative (“l’œil de l’âme”). In
its failure to bring out with sufficient explicitness this <i>creative</i> rôle of the
imagination and in the stubborn intellectualism that this failure implies
is to be found, if anywhere, the weak point in the cuirass of Greek philosophy.</p>

H. Hettner in his <i>Literaturgeschichte des 18. Jahrhunderts</i>. Compared with
Rousseau’s German influence, says Professor Paul Hensel in his <i>Rousseau</i>
(1907), “his influence in France seems almost trifling.” In Germany
“Rousseau became the basis not of a guillotine but of a new culture
(Kultur). … We have drawn his spirit over to us, we have made it our
own.” (121.) See also Professor Eugen Kühnemann, <i>Vom Weltreich des
deutschen Geistes</i> (1914), 54-62, and <i>passim</i>. German idealism is, according

many strange experiments. All this poetical activity, as we can see only too

I am reserving for a volume I have in preparation to be entitled <i>Democracy

(<i>Emile</i>, <span class="smcapuc">V</span>) and Schiller (<i>Essay on Naïve and Sentimental Poetry</i>) were

to the passages where the ethical imagination is required but where it does
not seem to prevail sufficiently over theology.</p>

proceeding in other respects on Kantian principles, he will reach results
similar to the “As-if Philosophy” (<i>Philosophie des Als Ob</i>) of Vaihinger,
a leading authority on Kant and co-editor of the <i>Kantstudien</i>. This
work, though not published until 1911, was composed, the author tells
us in his preface, as early as 1875-78. It will be found to anticipate very
strikingly pragmatism and various other isms in which philosophy has
been proclaiming so loudly of late its own bankruptcy.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
